</code></pre><p>evening, as usual, each department will prepare at least a program for the<br>party. Currently, I am not sure if there is a red packet of one thousand for<br>everybody as last year, but based on annual earnings of 2018, it should be no problem.<br>As to the first prize, it is said ten thousands cash will be given the lucky<br>guy instead of physical goods than last year. I think every employee concerns<br>who can win the first prize or what kind of prize they can have. As normal, the<br>general manger will do presentation at the beginning of the party and key<br>persons will be responsible for picking up lucky draw. Another difference is<br>the party place changed to better place than last year. That means this year<br>our company got a not good profit at least even outside environment was not<br>very good especially in automotive industry. As the forecast, the whole<br>economic status in automotive industry will continue to go down, so our company<br>also lower the expectation of sales volume accordingly in 2019. In a word, we<br>will face with more challenge increasing sales volume in 2019. If we don’t get<br>a good performance in 2019 that means we will have to reduce some profit as<br>response that we won’t to see. So, anyway, I do hope our company can run smoothly<br>and get a better performance year after year. </p>

<p>I don’t like download so many Apps to occupy my limitation<br>space, I only remembered Simple is perfect, Tao bao for internet shopping, which<br>is one of my favourite App. Ten cent video is watching movies and TV series,<br>for sure it must be have, Sina blog, Menu, Games and Daily Yoga. There are many<br>other Apps which are the network operator their own App like the dead bodies I<br>never use it. Updating App can be set up manually or automatically, I choose<br>the first one, because I like to know which app needs to be updated and where<br>and why this app has some new changes, I may pay attention for it carefully. For<br>example, Daily Yoga app it is almost every time updating app including it,<br>maybe the change is only a little, but I can see it in amount of others. Tao<br>Bao is a very famous app, there is no one but knows such a useful app, which is<br>only updating at the shopping day to add some of functions or some special bugs<br>need to fixed. But like not very well known app, the management people of it is<br>smart, using update App to drop people attention to it, to get better of other<br>dead body app.  </p>
<p>Even the app is free, Using update I can remember it,<br>it can tell when we do other works, if you want the people know you, you may using<br>your brain to learn this way.</p>

Normally after lunch I am starting busy to loading the things take<br>to Pan Shan home including foods, and then from 2pm I drive to pick Tiger up first<br>and go to Pan Shan directly. It is taken about one hour and a half on the high way,<br>after we are home, I am just doing my cleaning works for three floors and prepare<br>for the dinner as well. How busy I am you can see.</p>
<p>This Friday I did the same, I did not take care my<br>cell phone when I was busy with my jobs. After dinner I got the phone call<br>again, calling from one of my previous colleague said, have you seen your<br>wechat message yet? I just realized to check it up immediately, Helen she was a<br>financial assistant in the management corporation, Tai Yuan Kempinski GM Mr.<br>Alvaro Rautenberg wanted to look someone for helps. I knows this German guy who<br>was an F&amp;B Director for ages, He asked Helen for helps that’s why Helen<br>called me very urgently.</p>
<p>I added the guy in wechat at once, the guy still<br>remembered me when I was in the company, he said he wanted someone can do<br>Financial closing for coming month August, due to the new employee will only on<br>board at September 10th , maybe only for 3-4 days working. But you know<br>I will go to Thailand with my family at Sept 2 for 7 days, definitely I cannot<br>help for this time, so I was kindly to tell my reason and refused this<br>invitation to him, he was a little disappointed and he said it was good for<br>you, Rosanna. </p>
<p>In fact, only for few days I am unwilling to go to other city for busy<br>works, on the contrary if for the period, maybe one month or two months, for<br>travelling or for known some new friends, I would like to try and make some<br>small money, I do believe myself I can helps for financial closing after I left<br>the company for ages.</p>

So this time, each owner of departments afford big pressure, even big boss said if some non-conformance customer audited, the owner of departments will take accountability accordingly. We all knew, it is an easy thing to find some non-conformance as long as customer wants especially in the production line. From my opinion, if we can successfully pass the audit will depend on customer whether is in a good mood in a way, I know it is offhand. But, I still think it could affect the final result. Actually, we already did lots of preparation from the high level to bottom in company, but I also believe that there are still a lot to improve. Some actions we did after customer audit were really to meet customer&apos;s hobbies. Maybe, it is all each manufacture factory facing after all our orders come from customer&apos;s demand.     Anyway, I hope the audit day could pass through quickly so that we can go back to normal.

Last Sunday I went to there again for the business trip. Sort of windy and cloudy, as if I were in the winter. I still had few clothes and residents had already put on their thick coats and down jackets. I was more like an alien, but I did not feel that cold except for the gale. That afternoon, around 4 pm, it was clearly blue. That was because of the wind which blew away the haze.Every time I went to there, I only did the job and then went back in the hurry. Yesterday afternoon, I finished everything then I could have some time to while away. I took a walk to the Tienanmen square and many tourists taking pictures in front of it. It was a free walk in the night and I had something to eat in a mall before I got back to the hotel.Today I am back home again. The high speed train really runs fast. About five hours by the Fuxing bullet train, I was back at 3 pm. Warmer and fresher in the air, I felt much happier since I did not have to suffer the dry air in the capital. Home is the best.Though it is the place full of so called opportunities. It does not fit everyone. Those who can survive with handsome incoming have the chance to live. If not, ordinary guys who earn little are hardly to be sustainable living there too long. In reality, we have to be sure what we want. The goal can just be right for one’s ability, neither too high nor too low. The value of struggling for a better life is what we want. Meanwhile, we also have to be calm for the thing we believe in.</p>

And then there is a man coming out of nowhere, shouting and showering you with suggestions and orders: “Deep breath. Deep breath. How can you forget about deep breath? Run faster, another one is going to catch up! Watch your step! Can’t you see there is a stone on the road?” How would you feel about it? Would you feel appreciate about his suggestion, or his words, even probably they are right, would simply release some wild violence that is suppose to safely lock in your genes, and for a moment you want so much to knock him out with any brick you can reach? Some help is toxic, like a help from a back seat driver. I never realized that my husband could be so annoying. When he drove, I was glad to curl up in the passenger seat, taking a napping or enjoying the beauty out of the window. Since he got ill, I had to drive. And the nightmare started. Okay, I admit that I am not a good driver, but thanks to him, I become from bad to the worse. Yesterday, I was so irritated about his nagging, I didn’t notice that I crossed the solid line when changed the lane. For the first time, the police stopped me and gave me a ticket. Someone said, for man, driving is about control, it represents the power. Okay, I donï¿½t understand this logic of a man, and take whatever the power in it and just leave me with the peace.</p>

<p>I bought a baking oven which is made of by Germany; I<br>was told this is good quality with many of good comments in Jing Dong. And I<br>watched some videos and saw the procedure step by step how to making cakes or<br>breads those are very basic things on roasting, I have bought some tools and<br>food stuffs only for some specific items, which is including scale in gram, dough<br>maker, etc.</p>
<p>Do I have to attend the class for bakery? The first I<br>just want to learn by myself, maybe I don’t have enough patience after one or<br>two month later. So I would like to try Cranberry cookies, I thought this is<br>not too difficult for me, the stuffs I have already in my kitchen. So I looked<br>at basic recipe and procedure from the internet, to following the step by step to<br>start my first work, Please see the pictures, can tell I am smart, right? It was<br>really not bad, some good words and comment from my family for sure, that’s why<br>I have my confident now to do the next bakery at the following days.</p>
