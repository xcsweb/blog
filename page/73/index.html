This is my first time writing blogs on the Internet. In this blog, I will give a self-introduction.I came from a small village in Jiangxi, China. In my family, there are eight people currently, including my parents, my brother and his wife, one eight-year-old niece and tow little nephews. Each time when I came back home, the best time I had was having fun with these three little children.Now, I am 22 years old, studying at a university in Wuhan, Hubei. I have spent four years in this city. When I look back, the moment that I strived for TOEFL, GRE exams and experiments in the lab always appeared in my mind. Those are the most impressive and meaningful things during the past four years. Chasing dreams is always wonderful! Now, I was successfully accepted by my dream school and teacher, and the next chapter is to begin.As for hobbies, League of Legends is my favorite game. I have been playing it for six years since my high school. After going into college, keeping fit, running and playing tennis took most my free time. I enjoy the time when my body was moving on the playground and tennis fields. Taking a hot-water shower after sports certainly makes all unhappiness out! I have wonderful friend playing tennis together. We learned how to play tennis together in the first year and became great partners in the next three years. In some holidays, I will make trips alone to different cities around China and enjoy myself. I always enjoy alone, which gives me much freedom and room to achieve my ideas. Besides entertainment, I spent most of time on doing experiment in the lab and reading in a quiet place. I plan to write blogs for each books I am going to read after I join DioEnglish. Finally, I am going to end this blog. Quite happy to join this club! Hope to meet new friends here!</p>

When I was backing home, Tiger told me<br>his heart rate was so fast, and he had taken saving pills. I can see he looked<br>so uncomfortable from his face; I picked him to the sofa and let him lying down<br>immediately.</p>
<p>Everybody around Tiger knew that he has the<br>heart disease for some years, at the two years ago he had had heart operation<br>which was taken three hours, it was called Fang Shan in medical, even we<br>invited the famous doctor did the operation for him, we were so happy to know<br>it was perfect operation, after the time the heart attack came around once, we<br>did not go to hospital, just let him sitting down for a while, he was becoming normal.</p>
<p>But this time the data was showing 180 t in 15 minutes,<br>I was a little shuck and asked him to the hospital at once. You know Ji Xian is<br>only a small county in Tian Jian, There is a hospital far to our home around 20<br>km away. The time was limit for a heart attack person. I forced him into the car<br>to the hospital immediately.</p>
<p>I must say Tiger was so coolness facing the troubles;<br>he was opening GPS for the direction and called his friends for the helps on<br>the car, even there were many rate limited on the traffic, it was taken 20<br>minute more on the way, the speed of rate heart was still fast, I was so worry<br>about Tiger, I can see T-Shirt of Tiger was totally wet, I had to make sure<br>everything safe for my driving I told myself.</p>
<p>Luckily his friends had been waiting him at the<br>hospital in advance; I should thank so much to his friends here. Few of them<br>carried him to the emergence room directly. People says that good people<br>believes in pay backs. Yes it was, the doctor was a so experience woman, she<br>was calm down and let him injection a shot, his heart was becoming smoothly. How<br>dangerous he was? I understood people’s life was just in one second, if you did<br>not know how serious for the heart attack person, you might not see him today.<br>Luckily we went to the hospital instead of staying at him, luckily his friends were<br>so reliable, Luckily the doctor was so cool for a shot, Luckily Tiger was so<br>smart and strong when we were on the way. Back to think about those, I was so<br>fear after the horrible disaster.</p>

I entered an outsourcing technology company which is responsible for Huawei program.this is a totally wrong step and now I feel very regretful，I should have more thoughtful even if interview cross different cities is high-cost. The job in the outsourcing company is very uncomfortable and the part-A people is very difficulty to get along with and often blame us without reason.  When we work hard and still can’t complete the task on time,I think too much workload and unclear guide is the key,with little time to know about the business and then forced us to do exactly in the direction.but this unreasonable situation is reasonable in the company and I often feel stressful and annoyed in the daily work.too much working details made us mad.  I left the company in August and start the job-hunting again.Be honestly,I left it without hesitation.  Until now I still have no satisfied offer and it becomes closer and closer to the new year.  Sometimes feel calm and sometimes afraid,most time worry is around me,this is a tough time.  Actually I got two offer in August and the salary is not bad but that period I was something enjoyble at the leisure.the job description is not so satisfying and I refused them all.things turned down sharply at September.I have no job interview during this month and not soon it comes to October.I had some job interview this month and usually I can pass through it easily but the job were worse than the August ones.this made me feel very frustrated and I refused it again.  Now the recruitment is less and less,my heart is very cold and I don’t know whether my persistence is right,I push myself to so embarrassing situation.I don’t know how to do next step.  Now I can come back to Shanghai since find a satisfying job there is much more easy, or choose to waiting for a potential job that I really like.this drives me crazy since I don’t want to come back to Shanghai but I don’t know whether there is chance for my hope.’小小书写下自己的烦恼，愿2018有个好的结尾，job&amp;love&amp;family，希望难熬的日子赶紧过去吧’</p>

Well, Shakespeare is probably a bit<br>difficult for a six-grade. Every time when he is reading it, he looks like he’s<br>drinking vomit, with his face crumpled up all together. Three days later I<br>decided to do something about it, so I told him that I’ll read the English<br>version with him, and then we can make reading journal together. Of course, I<br>didn’t realize what kind of troubles I put myself in when I was saying<br>that.  Half an hour later, I stared at<br>the first chapter of Hamlet, wondering if I’d thrown all the years of my<br>English learning into the air.  I know 98%<br>percent of the words, but I just don’t know what the hell they are supposed to<br>mean when they are putting together in this way.  It all goes like this: But to recover of us,<br>by strong hand. And terms compensatory, those foresaid lands. So by his father<br>lost. Okay, I read Shakespeare in Chinese many years ago, so I can make a<br>guess. I even understand a bit more why Shakespeare is Shakespeare, I mean, if<br>you read it out, it’s smooth like the water, with all the rise and fall—if<br>you are not trying to figure out its meaning. “Mum, how about we read Harry<br>Potter together?” my son implored, “I prefer to read a whole book of Harry<br>Potter than a page of Shakespeare.” I must admit it’s a great suggestion. But<br>the Mum part inside me refused and she’s very adamant on this. “No honey, you<br>know we can’t run away from this.” I heard myself saying, signed, I returned to<br>the mysterious world of Shakespeare. </p>

When my little son was at home, I hardly enjoyed a quiet environment because he always pestered you playing games or taking him outside for funny, I can just have a short break while he was sleeping. The little boy seemed like having an endless of energy and he can keep an ability of moving from one place to another place without tiredness. What&apos;s more, he always easy attracted by something around him and easy distracted by something else. Sometimes, he was so naughty that I had to teach him a lesson as punishment, at that moment, he can realize mistakes he did, but, normally, he will quickly forget it no more five minutes, and the same mistakes may re-occur in a few days. It is the nature of children which don&apos;t to hide their true thoughts and show their true colors to people around them. For these preschoolers, most of times, they are simulating actions of adults from their parents.\    Anyway, hopefully wish my wife and my little son can have a pretty good vacation in my mother-in-law home.

Not because<br>of it is the harbour city, the weather is hot in summer, even it is one of modern<br>and updated one than others. People from Shanghai are not so openly when they<br>are doing something; it is my personal idea only, sorry for saying that. I am<br>from Beijing, some of Beijingers don’t like Shanghai citizens including me, I<br>don’t know why? Maybe it is hardly understand dialectal accent. </p>
<p>China has many famous cities. Beijing, the capital of<br>China, is the centre of politics, because it is where the central government<br>located. In the mid-west, Chongqing, another municipal city, is also the centre<br>of most forms of transport, but people in the world are always impressed by the<br>most distinctive city in China – Shanghai. Which is also be called the oriental<br>pearl.</p>
<p>All in all, Shanghai should definitely be counted as<br>one of the great cities in China. It is where two different cultures meet,<br>therefore. It has charming characteristics both in city planning and human<br>communication. As it is the national business centre as well as the East Asia,<br>Shanghai can always attract the attention from all over the world, enjoying the<br>ultimate advantages of further development. The graduated students would like<br>finding the first job in Shanghai to realize their potential. The owners would<br>like to buy the house in the big city including SH. For all these reasons,<br>Shanghai is a city that highlights the eastern part of China.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Shanghai is an important city in China,<br>and people should consider is as such, It has unique atmosphere for business,<br>entertaining or experiencing cultural exchange, Its fascinating combination of<br>traditional Chinese culture and latest and most advanced technology will make<br>anyone all in love with it.</p>

More and more people prefer indoorsy lifestyle, in other word, they would like stay at home, work or get leisure via the Internet. They consider indoorsy lifestyle is time-saving, active and peaceful. In contrast, some people who against the indoorsy lifestyle claim that keep an indoorsy lifestyle will do harm to people both psychologically and physically.    In my opinion, modern technology just like a coin which has two sides. If we consider it as an useful tool to make our life more convenient , it will bring us not only efficiency, but also improved our life. With the help of the Internet, one can save his time through working, shopping, or communicating with others at home. Besides, when you stay at home by yourself, free from outside disturbance, one can be creative and concentrate one’s mind on what he or she do. But if one relies too much on the Internet may ruin one’s  normal life and work. For example, indulging in social network online may make one’s social skills get worse. For instance, they may feel lost when talking with people face-to-face, which may affect their normal relationship with family members and friends. What’s worse, sitting in front of a computer all day long means little outdoor activities, which may damage one’s health.     When we are enjoying all the benefits the virtual world has offered to us, indoorsy people should also step out of their home from time to time and make some time to get into real life in order to get pace of the daily life and the society. Meanwhile, go to bed early, get up early, and do sports everyday give us a healthy body to enjoy our life, to fully experience high-tech bring us all kinds of miracles.搜索复制

Not until this situation appeared , did they realize sleeping is the trouble for them .It is hard to tell whether it is worth sacrificing the health on working , perhaps the extra return can counteract the worry .
