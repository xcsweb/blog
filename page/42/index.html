It was good for cycling but hard for the air-borne garbage to disperse. All the villages in the distance were shrouded in smog. As I drew closer to them, the grey curtain was gone.

The name is familiar to<br>me because it was one of the many films I had listened in to on the radio in<br>the 1980s in my teens. But its content had left on me a vague impression. The hero<br>dubbed into Chinese by Mr B is still melodious as before. And this was the<br>first time I’ve seen the film. The story is mediocre but the players’ acting is first-rate which moved me<br>to tears. It is really a good film and I can’t pinpoint any of our films<br>matching up to it. </p>

But the world thinks contrarily. So it’s enough for a child to be<br>excellent in his or her study. That’s why nowadays most youngsters know nothing<br>except for attaining high marks. They are praised and rewarded for their achievements<br>in study. They fail to realize the responsibilities they should take in other<br>aspects. They lack decent behavior both at home and outside. They feel no<br>gratitude to their parents and people who have helped them. They take it for<br>granted that their parents serve them as slaves attending their masters. They’re very selfish regardless<br>of others’ feelings.</p>
