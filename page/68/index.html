<p>Read the email from your manager. Then respond with an<br>email that has several ideas to help her solve the budget problem.</p>
<p>Hi Rosanna</p>
<p>I really need some help on creating some proposals for<br>the budget crisis. Please give me as many ideas as possible for cutting costs.</p>
<p>Thanks </p>
<p>Carla</p>
<p>Dear Carla</p>
<p>I have read your mail and let me give you my ideas for<br>saving the cost for our company. A large number of the cost is the salary and<br>benefits in our financial report, so the first option is to cutting everyone<br>back to 35 hours a week. Another possibility is to offer older workers a<br>retirement bonus. We may have to consider more drastic options, like cancel the<br>annual leave, reducing staff meal from three to two times a day. I believe<br>those can save a lot costs. Only as a last resort do we lay off workers. </p>
<p>Please have a look and Thanks! </p>
<p>Rosanna</p>

<p>I do care my swimming report regarding swimming motion<br>sensor: check detailed swim metrics such as laps, strokes, time and speed, and<br>calculate a SWOLF score to show swim efficiency from Garmin watch. I only can<br>swim of frog style and free style, I think well of myself for frog, it is more<br>easy for me, but free style which is always challenge for me, every time if I<br>played 1000 meters, among 800-900 meters I practiced more in free style, I<br>learned it must be match of your arms and legs with your breath, but I don’t<br>know where I was wrong of body, even I watched a lot videos how to swim and<br>listening the trainer to tell the main tips on line, in reality it is hard to<br>change my way.</p>
<p>One morning, When I was swimming as usual, one boy was<br>sitting in the corner who is the lifeguard of this fitness, I saw him before<br>but never talk, You know I am a sunshine lady, I like talking with others first,<br>the rather the boy is handsome, I asked him please give me some comments of my<br>swim, where is my problem? how can I swim faster? The boy told me with his smiling<br>face, you have many problems which we called bugs, and then he told me how to<br>do in detail from head, arm and leg, he set an example and demonstrated to me patiently.<br>I was trying remembered all what he said in each words, including how to turn<br>back fast in the pool, come to an understanding all of a sudden.</p>
<p>I tried to change my old way swimming these day, and<br>tasting the points and following his words, after one week later, yesterday<br>morning the report told me 26 minutes with 1000 meter, which was faster 2<br>minutes than before, I cannot believe this is truth.</p>
<p>I was so happy to know I can realize my potential if I do much efforts.</p>

First, I need to list task of everyday, and finish the important ones. I must use time properly and make sure, I am growing or getting closer to my goals. Second, I must face the environment, the people, the workmates or boss, to see what they are doing, and why they do it this way? To find someone as your model, learn them and start your own field.

She told me that she want to quit job and to be a housewife. I know she was not so earnest about that. I know that it&apos;s a hard work to take care our kids from my daughter&apos;s birth, and I can&apos;t go home to help her except the weekend because the long distance.  And she was blamed by his boss today.  It maybe just her complain. But She had said that several times. Should I will agree with her.       I don&apos;t want to let her quit her job not only for supporting the family, although it&apos;s a ignored reason.  I am not a rich man, and I just earn my salary in a common position. It isn&apos;t enough to to support the house loan, children education cost, daily life consume, and we have to take care our parents in the near future. I don&apos;t know if any accident will happen in the future. I think I can get a better job with a good salary before, but I am not confident with that after sending more than one thousand resumes this year. I even can&apos;t find a job near my home in order to take care my children. So I am not so confident with my career plan in the future. I found that I was a mid-aged man in other man&apos;s eyes now. It&apos;s not easy to get a position for a mid-aged man, especially it seemed that I am not so professional in one area.  All of that is a risk for my family, I can&apos;t afford all the family&apos;s future on my back. I will work hard to do better but I don&apos;t think I  can control the future.  It&apos;s irresponsible  for the family. Not only the excuse of me.      Then, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a good choice to be a housewife for a woman. Work is an important part of life in all my life although it&apos;s always hard. You can get your social hub, the sense of achievement and keep the pace with the social. I know  it&apos;s hard to take care little babies and it always make you crazy. But there will be only kids and TV in your life if you quit your job. The kids will grow up and leave you in the future and what will left in your life. And it&apos;s not easy to find a good job if you want to work again 10 years later. That must a sad story. And maybe I &apos;ll sick or dead in an accident, What will you do to support the children and parents. You may say that it is my excuse to avoid the pressure to support the family. But I really think that it&apos;s ture.       So, I don&apos;t agree with you. It&apos;s better for me, you and all the family.  And I will do more to take care all the family. All the hard time will passed.

<p>After married I am busy with the work and the<br>family, no time to enjoy myself, Till today when I am in my leisure time, or<br>shopping I still love to model making. One day I was watching TV to come out the<br>idea, Can I make our own model for my property, like many sale offices for<br>housing, Artificial miniature landscape of the building with lighting and scene<br>design. I can link my houses into one model according to the real situation. I<br>did a proposal in text and told Tiger about my idea. Surprise that I was kindly<br>rejected by him, he said how stupid you are, if you do it, all the people come<br>to see and will know about real states we have. I am simpler and only focus on<br>my hobby and I don’t care who knows or not.</p>
<p>Anyway, forget my first scenario if tiger disagree,<br>but I don’t want to give up my great thinking, why not doing the one to satisfy<br>the needs. Villa of Pan Shan it is Heng Da property which the main body of<br>house is design like European style, the green landscape is cover everywhere. I<br>can image how wonderful model of Villa which is the totally same with my real<br>house. That’s my way to let Tiger knows before I do everything first, maybe<br>that’s kind of respect for him. For sure it is cost a lot only for display,<br>even He was a little reluctant to keep silent, that’s why I love him. </p>
<p>I am trying to contact with the supplier at the<br>last week. I was told the model will be producing about two weeks, I have to collect<br>the pictures of villa as many as I can, including the beginning of design and<br>planer graph, surely I will ask the property office for the helps.</p>
<p>We are looking forwarding my baby come soon.</p>

Every time, it is a test to see if visitors have enough patience and energy to endure this hard and painful trip. Most of the time, they are on the way to wait for something, such as keeping the line in a train or a coach station, ordering a seat for in a restaurant or a hotel. etc. They are either waiting or on the way to wait. Wait, wait and wait. But it does not stop the enthusiasm of visitors. Anyway, we are seldom on a longer vacation than this. The the treading is unstoppable, many guys still join in the army of tourists.Have fun.</p>

<p>Maybe<br>you know nothing about Peter Dinklage, but you are bound to know about the role<br>he ever played in Games of Thrones. You bet！He was ever famous as Tyrion Lannister, the little<br>devil. </p>
<p> Suffering<br>achondroplasia, Peter Dinklage is only 1.35 meters high. Nevertheless, his<br>small figure does not hinder his excellence in acting. Besides Games of Thrones,<br>he also had roles in The Station Agent<br>and Narnia.</p>
<p> Believe<br>it or not, Dinklage did not find his ideal job until 29. Moreover, in his<br>darkness, he couldn’t even find a suitable shelter. Everything changed at his<br>age of 29. He found a job acting in a play called imperfect love, which led to a film called 13 moons with the same writer, which led to other roles. Since<br>then, he has spared no pains to work as an actor.</p>
<p> “Raise<br>the rest of your life to meet you.” Peter Dinklage said.</p>
<p> Facing<br>the fact that he would leave from data processing, Dinklage felt a little bit<br>anxious. But an idea stroke to him that he should make a difference in his own<br>life. It was this ambition that supported him to live up to his reputation.<br>After these trials, a thought came into his mind, “don’t search for defining<br>moments because they will never come”, “but only if you try again and again,<br>something starts to happen. Trust me. A rhythm sets in.”</p>
<p> Carol<br>Burnett once said, “only I can change my life. No one can do it for me.” So,<br>young man, what are you waiting for? Every chance brings out if we strive for<br>it. In this way, we are obliged to change ourselves. By achieving this, we<br>should change our mind. </p>
<p> And<br>remember, we burn so brightly, so please never stop.</p>

With that will, the UK had mastered its own destiny and turned the table. It is true if we say no to difficulties, we have higher possibility to get what we want. If we just give it up easily, we may lose many chances. And many of those chances will come to your side as long as you can wait for one more minute meanwhile remain cool in mind.

And unfortunately, all of my<br>resolutions have been achieved. Yes, you got me right here that I said in 2018,<br>I achieved all of my resolutions and yes, I said it was unfortunately. You see,<br>new year resolutions are made to break, right? So how many friends I am going<br>to lose now? </p>
<p>I learn, I read, I write, I walk 10,000<br>steps each and every day. Last year, I even managed to achieve the most<br>difficult two items, one, to exercise regularly, God knows how I hate to do<br>sports, but check my Keep record and you know my word is my bond, literally.<br>And the other one, to make new friends—it’s not easy for a person like me, I<br>was doomed to fail this one, but I joinned an online English corner and met a bunch of friends there–online friends are still friends, so you see, mission<br>completed. </p>
<p>Back at the time when I made these<br>resolutions. It was still at the end of 2017. With expectation for a brand-new<br>year, I had no idea what’s waiting for me ahead. I didn’t know my husband would<br>get ill and lose his job. I didn’t know that I would have some issues with my<br>own health. I didn’t know there would be a dramatic change in my job, one of my<br>boss would be transferred, and another would leave the company, which means<br>there would be a tons of adjustments, which means under such a critical<br>situation, I have to keep my job, with a little too many days off—because I had<br>to pay many visits to the hospital—certainly it’s not good when you were<br>between the bosses. And I didn’t know it would be so damn hard to choose a<br>middle school for my son. I knew it would not be easy, I just didn’t expect<br>that it would be that difficult. </p>
<p>Pressures kept mountain up. So, now you<br>know my secret to achieve the unachievable. I guess different people have<br>different ways of dealing with pressures. For me, when everything went out the<br>control, I was desperately to catch something still in my control. —It’s not<br>much, but New year resolution is one of them, so I take at it and grasp it. </p>
<p>And no matter what, it feels good. Okay, I<br>take my word-unfortunately back. I’m glad I’ve made it. New year resolutions,<br>or any resolutions, are not something out of your reach, you know, on the<br>contrary, they are so within your reach. To fail or to achieve, it’s totally up<br>to you. </p>
<p>In 2019, I will keep at what I’m doing. At<br>the same time, I need to slow down a little bit. New life comes from a new mind<br>and a new way of looking at your life. There is a better version of us around<br>the corner, and we need to find them. </p>
