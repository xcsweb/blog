<p>石壕吏</p>
<p>At twilight I put up at Shihao village for the night when I saw<br>the local bailiffs were recruiting soldiers by force. </p>
<p>暮投石壕村，有吏夜捉人。</p>
<p>The old host escaped by climbing over the wall.<br>And the old hostess went outside having a look. </p>
<p>老翁逾墙走，老婦出门看。How angrily the bailiffs was barking! How pitifully<br>the old woman was crying!</p>
<p>吏呼一何怒！婦啼一何苦！I heard the woman saying that her three sons<br>had joined the army attacking the rebels at Ye City and one sent a letter home<br>telling that the other two had just been killed in battle. 聽婦前致詞：三男邺城戍。一男附書至，二男新戰死。The survivors had to drag out an ignoble existence<br>temporarily. The deceased were gone forever.</p>
<p>存者且偷生，死者長已矣！There was no other man in the house except her sucking grandson,<br>whose mother did not leave for the child and she had no intact clothes for<br>going out. </p>
<p>室中更無人，惟有乳下孫。有孫母未去，出入無完裙。She added although she was old and feeble, she could go back<br>with the guys to the military camp at Heyang that night for the urgency of the<br>situation there. She hoped to be in time for preparing breakfast for the<br>soldiers. </p>
<p>老嫗力雖衰，請從吏夜歸。急應河陽役，猶得備晨炊。As the night advanced, the speaking ceased at last. It sounded<br>like someone weeping intermittently. On my leaving at daybreak, I bade farewell<br>to the old host alone. </p>
<p>夜久語聲絕，如聞泣幽咽。天明登前途，獨与老翁别。</p>

<p>新安吏</p>
<p>When I went<br>through Xinan county, I came across the noisy conscription there.</p>
<p>客行新安道，喧呼聞點兵。</p>
<p>I asked the bailiffs,<br>“Are there any men of draft age in such a small county？”</p>
<p>借問新安吏：“縣小更無丁？”“According to the<br>conscription document issued last night, the men aged 18 can be enlisted in the<br>army.”</p>
<p>“府帖昨夜下，次選中男行。”“How can these young teens be dispatched to guard the East Capital？”</p>
<p>“中男絕短小，何以守王城？”The stronger lads<br>could be seen off by their mothers, but the weaker ones were all alone.</p>
<p>肥男有母送，瘦男獨伶俜。The white water of<br>the river flowed east in the dusk. The weeping of the separated people still reverberated<br>through the blue mountains. </p>
<p>白水暮東流，青山猶哭聲。“Don’t cry your eyes<br>out. Please choke down your tears. </p>
<p>“莫自使眼枯，收汝淚縦横。The exhaustion of tears<br>will do you great harm. We must face the harsh reality, anyhow. </p>
<p>眼枯即見骨，天地終無情！It had been<br>thought that our troops could quickly wipe out the rebels at Xiangzhou. </p>
<p>我軍取相州，日夕望其平。Owing to our<br>misjudgment of the strength of the enemy, our troops were defeated one battalion<br>after another. </p>
<p>豈意賊難料，歸軍星散營。The recruits are<br>provisioned near the place where the troops had been stationed before and drill<br>on the outskirts of East Capital. </p>
<p>就粮近故垒，練卒依舊京。They are to be<br>assigned to light work such as digging trenches without reaching the<br>groundwater and herding horses. </p>
<p>掘壕不到水，牧馬役亦輕。Moreover, the<br>government troops are fighting for justice. The officers’ concern for the soldiers is very true.</p>
<p>况乃王師顺，撫养甚分明。You needn’t weep in grief at parting for the general<br>will show fatherly and brotherly love to your sons. ” </p>
<p>送行勿泣血，僕射如父兄。”</p>

<p>婦人在軍中，兵氣恐不揚。Oh, I’m from a poor family. It took us a long<br>time to make the wedding clothes. 自嗟貧家女，久致羅襦裳。I won’t wear the garments any more. Now let me<br>wash away the paint from my face before you.</p>
<p>羅襦不復施，對君洗紅妝。Look up at all<br>those flying birds in the sky, big and small, which are in pairs without<br>exception. </p>

In the past two years, my life had several episodes, leaving mixed feelings in the heart. But the two years is also a time when I wrote so little that some emotions have already diminished. This afternoon I thought of this corner where I had ignored for a long time and where nobody around my life knew. I wanted to update. Then the topic, which was not yet to have been put down in Chinese, sprang into my mind, and here it goes in English…————I think I will never forget the tears, falling down my grandpa’s sad face. In early May this year, it seemed to be my first time ever to see grandpa cry, helpless and heart-broken. Sitting in a wheelchair, he wiped away the tears slowly and silently with his aged hand, again and again, but no one around him passed tissue to dry the tears or said anything with comfort. Yes, including me, who dismissed the impulse. In others’ indifference, I realized mine.Due to geographical distance, in my childhood I only went to the grandpa’s, an old wooden house located in the foot of the mountain in a Fujian country, in spring festival or summer vacation. Since I could remember, grandpa was short-spoken and looked a bit severe. He smoked a lot. He often walked alone and sometimes brought snacks for us. He spent most of his life in the countryside surrounded by moutains. With grandma, he raised 6 children. When he was young, he had no chance to receive good education, but he tought them to study hard. Because of interval between generations and introverted personalities, it is such a shame that I’ve known so little about him, especially what his inner heart was like. From my mom, I could see some negative shadow that grandpa had given, such as insecurity, control, superstition, and the like. But I came to believe that under his strong appearance lived a tender and frail heart. In nearly two decades, he moved to the town and resided in my two uncles’ houses in turn. He used to appear healthy and walked with no difficulties. Till the age of 92, his health suddenly took a turn for the worse as he was diagnosed ileus. He lived in hospital for a few weeks but could not bear the pain caused by the illness. So he asked his sons with obstinate temper that he wanted to return home, giving up treatment and trying Chinese medicine. When it came to going home, he must have meant either of my uncles’. However, both uncles were afraid of his potential death, which was deemed ominous in Chinese traditional mindset and might bring trouble to the neighbourhood, so they came up with an idea privately that they would send back their father to the old house, which was actually abandoned for 20 years. It was seen that people’s cognition and attitude towards death could affect their behaviours and actions. My uncles and other family members were somehow controlled by the fear of death so they were afraid that someone would die at homes, even their beloved father. With much consideration, they allowed fear to overwhelm love. Frankly, I got a bit upset. How I wish I could own an apartment near the hospital so that the patient could get better care. But I was also aware of the dark side of humanity. I could not say if I were the uncle, I would show greater filial piety. In the same situation, I might be no better. Through this, I thought if my parents got ill someday, I would never dislike and avoid taking care of them in my house.On that day when my grandpa left hospital, I saw two lines of tears. At the moment, I thought he cried not only because the pain flared up. Maybe he felt hopeless for the coming days; maybe he had just learnt what awaited him was the desolate house; maybe he became depressed and disappointed at this decision; maybe he sensed solitude seeing others stand young and strong… Tears were falling quietly, but no one took actions to express concern and love! Well, it was possible that my elders did not notice grandpa’s tears, or it just accounts for our family’s implicit communication mode. Taking myself as an example, sometimes I’m sensitive and sympathetic, but I’d perfer focusing on my own feelings, rather than having the wisdom to care about people properly and timely. I know what to do but lack courage to act immediately.The scene drived me to weep with my grandpa, but pitifully I did not give him a hand. Even in that afternoon when grandpa arrived at his room in the old house, I could still get an opportunity to listen to him and talk with him, but I only said a few words and did not dare to strike up a long and heartfelt conversation with him about all that I wanted to tell him. Other family members were busy with clean work, and my mom and aunt looked after him from time to time. In that afternoon, I had a hunch that it might be the last time for me to see grandpa. For a man at his age, death could come at anytime… Pessimistic as I was, my mouth was not open for what I wished to say.Uncles, aunts, and my mother would stay to take care of him in turn. Next day I returned, hundreads of kilometers away from the old house. With worries and remorse, I consoled myself that grandpa’s illness was not fatal and that I might visit again in summer time. However, the thing went contrary to my wishes. On a Sunday morning in the end of June, the sad news finally arrived: my grandpa passed away. I could not imagine his last days, but a slice of grief welled up. I missed seeing him one more time; I missed the funeral on Monday; I missed bidding farewell. What’s worse, I blamed myself for I missed talking about gospel to him, leaving a kind of regret of not being able to speak out. For ever, I missed the things.Life is so short. For most time, I don’t stay with family. When I’m with them, we often hide emotions and don’t open hearts to each other. Although poor communications exist, I shall not take it as an excuse of not trying to improve the relationship with my family. No feast lasts forever, so before I’d rather stay “independent” and selfish so that when people leave I will not feel too sad and sorrowful. However, life is for love. I will never feel sorry about loving too much, but about not loving enough.I think I will never forget those tears, falling down my grandpa’s sad face. I wish I had given a hug, a hug that could warm the heart.</p>

In the past two years, my life had several episodes, leaving mixed feelings in the heart. But the two years is also a time when I wrote so little that some emotions have already diminished. This afternoon I thought of this corner where I had ignored for a long time and where nobody around my life knew. I wanted to update. Then the topic, which was not yet to have been put down in Chinese, sprang into my mind, and here it goes in English…</font></div><div><font face="Baby round">————</font></div><div><font face="Baby round"><br></font></div><div align="left"><font face="Arial">I think I will never forget the tears, falling down my grandpa&apos;s sad face. In early May this year, it seemed to be my first time ever to see grandpa cry, helpless and heart-broken. Sitting in a wheelchair, he wiped away the tears slowly and silently with his aged hand, again and again, but no one around him passed tissue to dry the tears or said anything with comfort. Yes, including me, who dismissed the impulse. In others&apos; indifference, I realized mine.</font></div><font face="Arial"></font><div align="left"><br></div><div align="left"><font face="Arial">Due to geographical distance, in my childhood I only went to the grandpa&apos;s, an<span .="text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; line-height: 25.2px; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-size: 14px; font-.: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline !important; white-space: normal; word-wrap: break-word; orphans: 2; float: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: transparent;"> old wooden house located in the foot of the mountain in a Fujian country, </span>in spring festival or summer vacation. Since I could remember, grandpa was short-spoken and looked a bit severe. He smoked a lot. He often walked alone and sometimes brought snacks for us. He spent most of his life in the countryside surrounded by moutains. With grandma, he raised 6 children. <span .="text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; line-height: 25.2px; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-size: 14px; font-.: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline !important; white-space: normal; word-wrap: break-word; orphans: 2; float: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: transparent;">When he was young, he had no chance to receive good education, but he tought them to study hard. </span>Because of interval between generations and introverted personalities, it is such a shame that I&apos;ve known so little about him, especially what his inner heart was like. From my mom, I could see some negative shadow that grandpa had given, such as insecurity, control, superstition, and the like. But I came to believe that under his strong appearance lived a tender and frail heart.&#xA0;</font></div><font face="Arial"></font><div align="left"><br></div><div align="left"><font face="Arial">In nearly two decades, he moved to the town and resided in my two uncles&apos; houses in turn. He used to appear healthy and walked with no difficulties. Till the age of 92, his health suddenly took a turn for the worse as he was diagnosed ileus. He lived in hospital for a few weeks but could not bear the pain caused by the illness. So he asked his sons with obstinate temper that he wanted to return home, giving up treatment and trying Chinese medicine. When it came to going home, he must have meant either of my uncles&apos;. However, both uncles were afraid of his potential death, which was deemed ominous in Chinese traditional mindset and might bring trouble to the neighbourhood, so they came up with an idea privately that they would send back their father to the old house, which was actually abandoned for 20 years. It was seen that people&apos;s cognition and attitude towards death could affect their behaviours and actions. My uncles and other family members were somehow controlled by the fear of death so they were afraid that someone would die at homes, even their beloved father. With much consideration, they allowed fear to overwhelm love. Frankly, I got a bit upset. How I wish I could own an apartment near the hospital so that the patient could get better care. But I was also aware of the dark side of humanity. I could not say if I were the uncle, I would show greater filial piety. In the same situation, I might be no better. Through this, I thought if my parents got ill someday, I would never dislike and avoid taking care of them in my house.</font></div><font face="Arial"></font><div align="left"><br></div><div align="left"><font face="Arial">On that day when my grandpa left hospital, I saw two lines of tears. At the moment, I thought he cried not only because the pain flared up. Maybe he felt hopeless for the coming days; maybe he had just learnt what awaited him was the desolate house; maybe he became depressed and disappointed at this decision; maybe he sensed solitude seeing others stand young and strong… Tears were falling quietly, but no one took actions to express concern and love! Well, it was possible that my elders did not notice grandpa&apos;s tears, or it just accounts for our family&apos;s implicit<font color="#0b0111"> </font>communication mode. Taking myself as an example, sometimes I&apos;m sensitive and sympathetic, but I&apos;d perfer focusing on my own feelings, rather than having the wisdom to care about people properly and timely. I know what to do but lack courage to act immediately.</font></div><font face="Arial"></font><div align="left"><br></div><div align="left"><font face="Arial">The scene drived me to weep with my grandpa, but pitifully I did not give him a hand. Even in that afternoon when grandpa arrived at his room in the old house, I could still get an opportunity to listen to him and talk with him, but I only said a few words and did not dare to strike up a long and heartfelt conversation with him about all that I wanted to tell him. Other family members were busy with clean work, and my mom and aunt looked after him from time to time. In that afternoon, I had a hunch that it might be the last time for me to see grandpa. For a man at his age, death could come at anytime… Pessimistic as I was, my mouth was not open for what I wished to say.</font></div><font face="Arial"></font><div align="left"><br></div><div align="left"><font face="Arial">Uncles, aunts, and my mother would stay to take care of him in turn. Next day I returned, hundreads of kilometers away from the old house. With worries and remorse, I consoled myself that grandpa&apos;s illness was not fatal and that I might visit again in summer time. However, the thing went contrary to my wishes. <span .="text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; line-height: 25.2px; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-size: 14px; font-.: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline !important; white-space: normal; word-wrap: break-word; orphans: 2; float: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: transparent;">On a Sunday morning i</span>n the end of June, the sad news finally arrived: my grandpa passed away. I could not imagine his last days, but a slice of grief welled up. I missed seeing him one more time; I missed the funeral on Monday; I missed bidding farewell. What&apos;s worse, I blamed myself for I missed talking about gospel to him, leaving a kind of regret of not being able to speak out. For ever, I missed the things.</font></div><font face="Arial"></font><div align="left"><br></div><div align="left"><font face="Arial">Life is so short. For most time, I don&apos;t stay with family. When I&apos;m with them, we often hide emotions and don&apos;t open hearts to each other. Although poor communications exist, I shall not take it as an excuse of not trying to improve the relationship with my family. No feast lasts forever, so before I&apos;d rather stay &quot;independent&quot; and selfish so that when people leave I will not feel too sad and sorrowful. However, life is for love. I will never feel sorry about loving too much, but about not loving enough.</font></div><font face="Arial"></font><div align="left"><br></div><div align="left"><font face="Arial">I think I will never forget those tears, falling down my grandpa&apos;s sad face. I wish I had given a hug, a hug that could warm the heart.</font></div><font face="Clerical"></font><font face="Bold"></font><font face="Courier"></font><font face="System"></font><font face="Clerical"></font><font face="Arial"></font><div><br></div></div><hr></div><div class="recent-post-item"><a class="article-title" href="/blog/2019/11/03/This_is_a_story_(Part_3)/">This is a story (Part 3)</a><time class="post-meta__date"><i class="fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></i> 2019-11-03</time><span class="article-meta tags"><span class="article-meta__separator">|</span><i class="fa fa-tag article-meta__icon" aria-hidden="true"></i><a class="article-meta__tags" href="/blog/tags/learn-english/">learn english</a></span><div class="content"><p>Chapter 12: Tenth, Terrible, Test Text,<br>textbook</p>
<p>“Dragon Alley, the Tenth Street” Sabrina heard a familiar demanding voice coming from<br>the other side phone “About ten o’clock, you would see a man in grey dumping<br>the garbage. Take it and meet me at the cottage.” Before Sabrina said anything,<br>he hung up the phone. “Damn it! Sabrina cursed, “A textbook example of a chauvinist.”</p>
<p>No matter how displeased with his bossy<br>manner, three hours later Sabrina still showed up in front of the cottage, with<br>a bag of stinky garbage. And another half an hour later, Lord Howard—the only name<br>he gave to Sabrina–finally found what he’s looking for: a very strange looking<br>white box. It was obviously being brutally destroyed. Lord Howard murmured<br>something, casting a spell to reconstruct the original text on it. Two Words finally showed up, but Sabrina couldn’t<br>recognize them. “Changchun Changsheng” he explained it to Sabrina: “It’s bio-technology<br>company in China, one of the Muggle Countries. This company sold the inferior<br>vaccines to more than 250000 children. About two years ago this terrible scandal outbroke, gripped<br>this country, and put the entire nation into crisis of faith.  Nature of greed, something can always stand<br>the test of time.  Anyway, afterwards it was shut down. But the<br>drugs, vaccines inventory also disappeared.” </p>
<p>Chapter 13：than thank that<br>the theatre</p>
<p>“Excuse me, my lord. But what<br>does that have to do with anything?”<br>Sabrina blurted out. She felt that she was almost drowning in a whirlpool of<br>puzzles. Hardly had she solved one than<br>another came up. </p>
<p>“Might or might not. But when<br>your father thought Buck was smuggling sugar into this country, he made a<br>mistake. What Buck really shipped was those vaccines from China. And he with the vaccines were last seen in Dragon<br>Alley, where Spitz, one of the most powerful wizards, is said to live.” Sabrina<br>was momentarily dumbfounded by this news. “But what for? Our children don’t need<br>vaccines against any infectious disease. And you told me Spitz was behind all<br>this?” “Scared?” he chuckled. “Of course not, what else could I possibly have<br>to lose? It’s just like fitting tiny pieces together to form a giant piece, but<br>all you got is just small part of it, and you don’t know which one fits where,<br>that’s all.” “Then go to Theater de<br>Paris at midnight, and you might find another piece in Box Five.” “What?<br>“Sabrina raised her voice almost to a shout, “You want me to go to a haunted box<br>in a haunted theatre at midnight? Thanks,<br>but no thanks!” </p>
<p>Chapter 14: their, theirs, them,<br>themselves, then</p>
<p>Then at midnight, Sabrina found herself stumbling along a<br>muddy lane. At the end of it was a dark, huge building—the Theatre de Paris.<br>For a ruin it was in good condition, as though the place was still being used.<br>If there was any place in this world that Sabrina was afraid of, here it was.<br>In fact, it scares off everyone in this kingdom. Their deeply-rooted fears could trace back into decades ago. Once<br>Theatre de Paris was the favorite place of theirs,<br>with its elegant style and mesmerizing performances, this theatre gripped their<br>attentions and attracted them like<br>moths to the flames. Anyway, it is one of those places where people would<br>indulge themselves in pure pleasures<br>of sensations.</p>
<p>Chapter 15:  there, these, they, thick, thief</p>
<p>Its other great claim to fame was<br>its owner—Erik. There were a lot of<br>rumors going on about him, but none of these<br>could tell where he came from, who he really was, and even what he looked<br>like—because was never seen without a thick<br>mask on his face. Only one thing they had known for sure: he had incredible<br>talents in music. That’s the major reason for its overwhelming popularity. No<br>one could resist the temptation of the music in Don Juan Triumphant, which<br>Erick created it himself, and they<br>called it as “Music from the Angels.” Everything had changed when one night, a thief, broke into his room and stole a<br>ring, which he had never took it off his finger. How did that thief managed to<br>steal it—it was still a mystery and would remain a mystery forever. Because the<br>next morning the thief found died, in the most terrible way, at home and the<br>stolen ring was gone.</p>
<p>Chapter 16: thin, thing, think,<br>third, thirteen</p>
<p>And almost at the same time, the splendid<br>Theater De Paris was gone, replaced by a ghastly, haunted building. Since that<br>day no one could be able to come near to this place—including the most powerful<br>wizard. Every year at three o’clock am in July 13th, people could hear someone singing the most heartbreaking song<br>from a distance. The song was sad, but surprisingly it had sort of healing<br>power, giving hope to the hopeless, and making you cry and smile at the same<br>time. There was only one person who could enter this building—Sabrina. It was<br>supposed to be a secret, a secret only Sabrina and her father knew. Many years<br>ago, on July 13th, Sabrina’s 6-year-old birthday, she got lost in Third Street. The crowd gradually thinned off and then Sabrina found<br>herself in a dark lane with no one else around. This dark and hard building,<br>abandoned by the summer light, should make her scared. However instead, a sense<br>of loneliness stole over her. Something in this building was calling for her,<br>alluring her to come closer. And the strangest thing happened, the invisible wall which blocked everyone out<br>disappeared. Without a second thought,<br>Sabrina entered in the Theatre De Paris.</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Thirty,<br>this, those, though thought</p>
<p>What<br>had happened next was a blur. Theatre De Paris was like those palaces in fairy tales which had been cursed and abandoned,<br>waiting in the last thirty years for<br>the one who could break that cruse to show up. The dusky light inside seemed to<br>create more shadows, instead of driving them away. Suddenly Sabrina heard someone<br>moving, with a light, stealthy step, up to the stairs. Without troubling for a<br>reason, she followed up. The footsteps stopped at Box 5. But it was empty.<br>Sabrina started to panic and tried to get out. Just then, she heard this most unforgettable music, so<br>beautiful, so mesmerizing, so unbelievably wonderful. She thought everything inside, every piece of her soul, seemed to be drawn<br>out toward the invisible singer. When it was over, she caught a glimpse of a<br>shadow moving. “Wait! Please…” she ran toward it. The shadow pause, though, for just a few seconds. It was<br>enough for Sabrina to catch it up. She raised her head and only saw a pair of<br>scorching eyes, like a wild wounded animal, like the death itself. And she<br>remembered nothing more until she recovered consciousness at her home.</p>
<p>Day 19: Thousand, three, through,<br>throw Thursday</p>
<p>When the setting sun threw long shadows over the sea, the<br>last sunlight filtered through<br>Sabrina’s window. </p>
<p>“How could you<br>get into that theatre?” For a thousand<br>times, his father asked and for a thousand times, Sabrina couldn’t give out an<br>answer. It’s dangerous to be different, especially for a normal little girl to do<br>something that a wizard couldn’t. </p>
<p>“Promise me, my<br>dear, what happened on Thursday<br>night is a secret. Never mention about it, and never, never go to that place<br>again” </p>
<p>Until now, Sabrina still<br>remembered quite clearly her father’s face when he said that. However, fate<br>once again led her along the same lane into the unknown. </p>
<p>And it’s three minutes to go<br>before the midnight.</p>
<p>Day<br>20: Ticket, tie, till, time, tired. </p>
<p>Just<br>as Sabrina was about to step into the building, she heard a tired voice whispering by the ear: “Got<br>you. “The hair on Sabrina’s whole body stood up and time seemed to stand still for this moment. And then<br>she must have blacked out for a couple of minutes. The next thing she knew, she<br>was tied tightly by some magic spell<br>to the tree outside of the theatre. She struggled to break it free, only was<br>interrupted by the voice that felt upon her ear saying in vicious tone: “Dear<br>ghost, you rejected my offer twice. But I guess this time it would be<br>different. See, I got my free ticket,<br>didn’t I? “The invisible rope that around her neck suddenly tightened up.<br>Sabrina felt her life slowly draining away, and she couldn’t help letting out a<br>whining. </p>
