In fact my<br>heart had been flying to Hai Nan of my friends. </p>
<p>Jiang Li my good friend, she bought the house in Lin Shui<br>of Hai Nan province, five of us were invited by her and her husband kindly in this<br>cold winter for two weeks, luckily I was in Zhan Jiang, it was not too far to<br>be there, so I can fly to her directly after my own business.</p>
<p>Lin Shui is a famous place to invest house for North<br>part people, due to there is a beautiful seaside and not too many people yet,<br>it is the county, to be there I have to go by train. Social network has had a<br>very positive effect in our life, the tickets by air and by train were all<br>settled in the smart phone just one bottom in advance. LiLi and her husband<br>picked me up in the station on time, I was so moved when I saw her, I felt<br>finally I found out our team.</p>
<p>Four of them have come to Lili place one week ago; I<br>did not how they lived and how to have the meal together, I thought they may<br>rent an apartment in the same community, even I knew LiLi is a so kind and<br>honest to her friends always, to my surprised, all of them were eating together<br>at her home and living their friend’s apartment by free. Due to the new house<br>did not open water yet, all of them took the shower in LiLi’s home one by one and<br>day by day, How come? The hotel nearby is very convenient including the<br>breakfast, the room rental is reasonable I checked, why don’t they live outside<br>instead of bothering the trouble to LiLi, If I were LiLi I cannot accept it<br>even my relatives. So the first day I came, I had very rude suggest to every<br>one of the friends. Should we move out to the hotel for the following days? No problem<br>I can pay the room of hotel. </p>
<p>LiLi for sure did not agree my idea and insisted leave<br>it like this politely. Even other people agreed my action wanted to pay<br>afterward by 1000 each for the compensation, I had to accept and starting our<br>group living for following days.</p>

By doing so, we think it confident to conquer whatever we meet. Sometimes we are fragile and we are desperate to require the comfort to console the soul. Therefore we need to be ready at any time. Not a single moment could be easily wasted. Since life is so short.Most of the time we may be wondering and having no idea what we should do and what exactly we want. This is normal and we all have that tough time to come through.Do not be sad and do not be overexcited, things are just fine which are usually neither so good nor so bad. It does not mean we tend to be a cold-blood person, actually it has the high quality which needs us to master the smooth mind and cultivated behavior.Everyday is the in the course of self-training. We meet lots of things and undoubtedly we are easily to be involved in various kinds of temptations. We definitely have to sharpen eyes. The tough thing is some of those potential risks and unexpected things can not be detected and recognized by naked eyes. Then, what should we do?To read more books, to meet more people, to experience as much as we can. Only by doing this do we realize how to judge and analyze. We won’t be kids anymore. We grow to be more mature. Time tells of the achievement we made.Do what we can, change what we ought to have to do. Every bit of move makes to be great one day. You can not rely on the good result which comes out in a short time. As a matter of fact, it costs much time and consumes us energies to wait it out.</p>

The location is in south east of Beijing, it<br>is quite far from my home, I looked up BaiDu map before I left, how can I get<br>there? I prefer green outing, so By subway or by Bus? Both are at least taking<br>more than one hour.</p>
<p>We made the plan to meet at 1am clock after lunch; Hai<br>Yun was afraid me to lost my way and She would pick me up at bus station. Unfortunately<br>I was waiting the bus almost 20 minutes later at the starting station, even<br>there are so many buses passing by except my bus. You know I am a punctual<br>person since my school time. I had few to be late for any appointments, unless<br>there must be some strong reasons. finally I was afraid to be late, I took the<br>taxi immediately.</p>
<p>Surely I was 30 minutes early than others, I came in<br>the fitness first, it is quite big fitness centre I have seen before with<br>semi-underground, The logo of the name in bilingual language was so attractive.<br>Gtime-吉刻 I<br>like the name because it is simple and perfect, the meaning on my understanding<br>is Don’t hesitate, Just do it. I was following one staff to each function rooms<br>and told me how to using facilities one by one professionally, I knew it is<br>their job for any new comers.</p>
<p>I can not wait to do the excise first till my friends<br>coming, all machines are quite new and update with individual TV which is continent<br>to kill the time on the machine for sportaholic, and many of people in different<br>ages were interacting on the machine. The swimming pool is not so big but just<br>next to the room. Group of people were busy learning swimming with their coach concentrated,<br>seems nobody cared who you are, only focus them.</p>
<p>After my friend was coming, for sure we were happy to<br>see again since last meeting in Hai Nan, we used our own way to chat for a<br>while in a low voice, taking the photos in any corners must be our issues for<br>any gatherings. Unluckily I forgot to take my swimming suit, Hai Yun who are my<br>dear would like to go back her home to take her one. Why I love them all, because<br>if anyone of us has a problem at the anytime, they would like to give you fully<br>supports at once,</p>
<p>The friend in need, is a friend indeed. This<br>is my point of this blog.</p>

Yesterday, it was too damp to breathe. Now it comes to be comfortable to feel free breath. The big rain, particularly in summer, is a nice way of test on the drainage system. Every city more or less has to confront this problem. The civilization based on the concrete construction has its disadvantage. Sometimes it is even more fragile than we have thought. Usually in hours of heavy rainfall, it will flood roads and streets. Engines of vehicles are likely to fail when it comes to pondings, traffic paralyzed and garbage washed into everywhere. Compared to the rain itself, the disaster of urban water logging afterwards is more severer and destructive.Section two:The second half year is about to begin. How fast it is. If there was no plan, life goes to be boring. Though so many things we have to deal with, it does not hamper us from pursuing happiness. A better tomorrow does not only rely on the material life, but also the quality in mental. To spare some time on something we like is just that way to improve our life. Reading, workout, diet and rest are the priority on my list. By insisting on it, I have found that I tend to be considerate. I am not easily to be impulsive, instead, I become reasonable and sane knowing how to steer the direction to life journey. That is totally different than what I was before. It teaches me and I appreciate it greatly.</p>

One month ago I<br>was looking forward the day coming, how could I spend my day? What kind of gifts<br>I can receive from my friends or my family? Hopefully some surprises or miracle<br>coming to me at the day.</p>
<p>Tiger asked me what kind of gift you want at two weeks<br>ago, I know he loves me, he was not a pincher at the day to buy something for<br>me. He never asks what I bought from the internet or shopping mall, only if too<br>many packages delivery to my home, He might say, please don’t blind to spend<br>money. </p>
<p>In fact I really want an unmanned plane or a lap top, anyone<br>at lease is over 10 thousands, I know it is more expensive for the gift, an<br>unmanned plane is not so suitable play in Beijing, due to many places are forbidden.<br>And I have desk top and I pad, which can instead of the lap top I think. So forget<br>those two. I had a crystal bracelet at the long time ago, but it was broken and<br>hard to fix, maybe I can buy another one for myself. The price is within 300<br>yuan, can accept, Yes it was good I like it. I buy my birthday gift for myself,<br>even Tiger has promise to pay later.</p>
<p>The day was Sunday, for sure my family was all in Pan<br>Shan for weekend, because of my birthday, so my daughter was also coming for<br>the celebration, her gift for me was a dark red skirt with pockets, she knew<br>what I like. My nephew was the same day of birthday with me, so every year of<br>day we have the meal together with his family for the celebration. I was so<br>happy when the candle was lighting and all of family people were singing birthday<br>song to both of us.</p>
<p>After back to home after the big lunch, other surprise<br>to me, a fresh flower Lilies and Roses, Tiger bought the flower for me on the<br>way home, He was not a romance guy, but today I just tell you here today, he is<br>the one, I love you Tiger. I love you my daughter, I was so spoiled by my<br>family, right? </p>

That’s why a lot people just for the day, working overtime<br>before the day, trying to finish the all the work. Many stores have to be<br>closed by nonlocal bosses and back home as early as they can. Overseas Chinese<br>booked the return tickets at the half year ago. All just for catching the day<br>of Chinese Eve.</p>
<p>Luckily I am local here, and most of my relatives are<br>all in my city, so I don’t need to think about ticketing booking before the<br>holiday. This year it was my turn to take care my father in low. Because of the<br>last year his brother was in charge. I knew A Yi she must be go home during the<br>holiday, so I had to find somebody instead, otherwise I cannot image How can I take<br>care the old man 24 hours personally, I am lack of patient even my mom. </p>
<p>Anyway new A YI I have found the one by accident. She<br>is from Dong Bei province, she is a easy going person, She is working in Beijing<br>to the baby sister more than one year, she is just absent at the holiday, she<br>is willing come to my home, just as it happened, This new AYI is a really qualify<br>assistant and good at cooking. On the working day she is easy motion, general<br>good character, what I told her, she can remember my point clearly.</p>
<p>At the day of eve, as traditional Chinese way the<br>family has to go to man’s house, maybe the man is the king of family. So after<br>I married I have no chance go to my home at the eve. This year luckily after<br>big lunch with tiger’s family, we were allowed go back our own home for the<br>golden evening. A Yi gave us a lot helps for prepare the eve dinner. This year<br>the same day of the beginning of spring, spring pancake has to have at the day,<br>so she made it instead of dumpling, There were BBQ big prawn, pork knuckle,<br>lotus cake and fried fish, what I liked was Rio which is kind of drink, the advertisement<br>by pop star Zhou Dong Yu recently</p>
<p>So this year eve evening I was so happy with my family<br>at my own home, hopefully every year I can have the same year eve.</p>

Half a year?  How many ten years do we have in a lifetime? How many years<br>are there within ten years?  And how many<br>half a year in a year?  And how many months in half a year? Half a year can be critical on some occasions.  The days of  the Three Big Battles during the War of Liberation in late 1940s put together did not last more than half a year.  In retrospet, in half a year my study from almost<br>scratch of mathematics, physics and chemistry enabled me to be lucky enough for an admission for a university. I also remember the time as a senior when I listened to the broadcast music<br>lectures for half a year before getting an award for its music knowledge  contest aftermath.
