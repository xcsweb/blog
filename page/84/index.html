To uncover or not, it really annoys us; to accept or not, it is really a different decision to make when it gets unveiled.Sometimes I was in my feelings that day about that particular situations, good or bad times. I got the good side of you, as well as the bad side of you. I realize, I haven’t completely forgot about you; I apologize, I wish that this wasn’t the way things were going down. I have seen all these amazing places and been through all these crazy experiences. I got the good side of life, so many thoughts I want to share, I hope you can understand.Cover or uncover, depending on our hearts. For me, I am always on the road of healing, and am always to be a healer for myself or others. Everything is a mirror for your own internal state. Just let it be. No matter whom I meet, he is the person in my life.  </p>

The reason why they broke off the connection is that one of the Versace’s T-shirt was printed Hong Kong is an independent country. That means Hong Kong isn’t belongs to China.When this issue discovered by Chinese ,it caused a great disturbance and people’s indignation on the internet. The first time she heard the new,she deleted all the microblogs which related to Vercase in only two hours.I think is was really amazing!   The rescission incident will cost Yang Mi and her company too much liquidated damages.And it will affact her fashion resources obviously in the future. But she gave up all at the first time without hesitated. Because she and her team both understood in the face of national interest ,everything is going to be unimportant include her capital.So she did a correct decision on this event.And it must be a reason why I loved and admired her forever. I also believe that each of Chinese would praise and support her sincerely.</p>

I was informed by my elder<br>brother at two weeks ago, we were going to be there with my dear mother and<br>other brother at the end of March.</p>
<p>I have two uncles at my mother’s family, the elder one<br>has passed away at four or five years ago, this uncle is over 80 years old, he<br>is more healthy and energy except his listening is little weak than others. He worked<br>in railway administration at Lan Zhou city at the beginning and then He transferred<br>to Yin Chuan city with his family for 30 years, He has two boys are all has<br>good occupation during the time, right now they wanted to go back the home town<br>to enjoy the rest of life. They self build the house at the traditional countryside<br>where is the old house of his grandpa’s. I know many of the white collars cannot<br>afford the cost of house in the big city, instead of buying the housing in the secondary<br>city or countryside, I am totally agree the good idea for young people or for<br>their parents. I have not gone back my mom’s home town for many years. My memorize<br>was only when I was a little girl at there, this invitation I was so happy I<br>can go with my family to feel the nature view and see some relatives. </p>
<p>We were going to stay there for three days with two<br>nights, it was taken about three hours by car from Beijing to He Be. My mom is<br>86 years old, even it is not too far, but this outing is also the challenge for<br>her, surely we hope everything is smoothly. Four of us started up at last<br>Friday after Tom sweeping for my father.</p>
<p>My mom home town was fall behind. There were many surprises<br>for this trip I can see, the first one was the roads are changed so wide and straight,<br>the dirt road were all disappeared. When we were there, the antique arched entrance<br>with the name of the village was just aside of street, it was so impressive for<br>me, surely I took the photo for my blog afterward. I was told the gas and the electricity<br>had been into each home at recent years, I thought the gas tank was not bad for<br>countryside at the moment. The carts and cars were in and out from this<br>entrance. To be continue. </p>

<p>There was a big courtyard with steel gate, I have<br>never seen such big courtyard before, it can be parking four or five cars at<br>least, I was told the house is about 300 square meters with 6 living rooms, one<br>study room and laundry room, there are three bath rooms, it was build for two<br>years including digging the foundation, I like sunshine so much, so there are<br>four living rooms are at the south, you can enjoy the sunlight totally in the<br>room. Some furniture is still on the way, and paper wall is not ready yet, but<br>I like the sliding door at the kitchen and toilet, which are so easy to push<br>and pull.</p>
<p>I paid more attention on the detail of the decoration,<br>the different colour in different room, one room is in pink, one is in green<br>and other one in light blue, like curtain, bedding article and some small goods<br>on the shelf are so match in one room, I was told it was doing by daughter in<br>law who is from the countryside as well, I asked her she must be taken a lot of<br>time for the design and arrangement, it was really not easy for her, due to her<br>husband was not around there during this two years of self-building, I cannot<br>accept such big burden trouble without hermy husband. So we cannot look down any<br>person who comes from city or countryside, anyone can be the great around you;<br>just you don’t know who is super or genies.</p>
<p>Many of relatives were around us; I was holding my<br>mother to enter the room slowly. This was a really big party, and I had no time<br>to take videos and photos for the moment, so pity to miss the change to record,<br>only had some taken by others. To be continue. </p>

<p>At the third day we were going to see my aunt, she is<br>my father’s younger sister from countryside; She is about 80 years old as well.<br>But her health is good except her leg a little bit bending; she lives in the<br>countryside, every morning she gets up early and never stop for her farm works,<br>So works making her more strong and healthy enough than the same ages people others<br>who lives in down town or city. She has three boys, unfortunately the elder one<br>has passed away by cancer for some year, right now the second one has hold up<br>the home totally, I can understand my aunt is really not easy for her family<br>and the life.</p>
<p>The second boy is the same age as mine, so when we were<br>here to his home, my aunt and he has been waiting us with warmly regards and smiling,<br>I can see this village is not rich as my uncle’s, they still live in the old the<br>courtyard and house, we were told they are waiting the house pulled down and<br>move out by the local government. Hopefully it will be taken as soon as<br>possible. The first attractive me that there are many dry plant which is hard<br>to call the name is handing the shelf a raw of raw at the corner. </p>
<p>An Guo city was a county in the before, it is famous<br>for Chinese medicine in China everybody now, the second boy lives on selling Gua<br>Lou at the local market to support the family in his life, which is kind of<br>plant grow from the field, his work is processing into medical materials, it is<br>very complicated for each procedures I was told. It needs to be dried, baked and<br>cut to the slice at the last by seasoning, only a few months a year, so it needs<br>the baking toast, the special cut knife and space for dryer. So anything work<br>is not easy for working people.</p>
<p>I told them if you want to sell to other cities<br>instead of only local area, you’d better selling from the internet and doing<br>some advertisements, it is limitation informed by wachat only. Let everyone<br>knows it is the best one in China.     </p>

Some spend much time on contemplation about if there is a panacea to solve problems, others do little about moving forward since they never plan to think, only a tiny little portion of those guys have realised the importance of the combination about the moves and thoughts. Anyway, we do fear of making mistakes.Such kind of a situation works in almost every field. Yet, it does fail on those who really want to change. How about the action which might not be eventually coming out what we want. Does that mean we have to get out of the way? Never.Easier said than done. Huh? Right. First we have to admit we are not impeecable. Second we must find what we are gifted. Supposing we are nothing, is there a way to figure out guiding the path to an ideal destination?The answer is Yes. But, there is a HOW. And a WHY comes after it. A big problem is we can not tell the current situation which we are involved in. A good way is to go out and hike to somewhere. To be with trees and wind, probably you find the answer. To overview everything from the top of a hill, your horizon is highly improved to a new level. Amazingly. All of a sudden, you are to capture the outline of your routine. Sooner or later, you screen out what is the best option you can have.Naturally, there is no absolute answer. You are the one who can measure your ability and judge what you are adequate to. After kicking out, the ball has no answer for audience, it only comes out when it ends. The score is made by efforts through tactics, wit and energy. We learn to be wise.</p>

At some point, we have to interact with people we don’t like. Maybe I can’t completely avoid one because they are a co-worker, a neighbour, or even a family member. Sometimes, we may say something we later regret or storming off in a temper, which usually can end badly.To get through the bad emotions we have to take some proactive measures and striving to keep an positive outlook. The longer you are around the person, the more irritated you are likely to become. We should keep encounter with short and sweet if they are just a common one. If you absolutely must be around the person, at least put some space between the two of you, and try to look at the situation from their perspective. Consider why the person acts the way that they do. Focus on the positive things and do something to help yourself feel better. If you love working out,go to the gym to get your mind off things. If you have friends who appreciate you, spend time with them to remind yourself of your self-worth. If you cannot change other people then change yourself.To live like an idiot, to work like a nut for myself in the new year. </p>

I drove it back from the 4S store and rent a parking space in our community.  I even don&apos;t exited for the new car because I don&apos;t confirm the necessary of a car till now. But I don&apos;t want to wast time to hesitate if we should have a car, which car is more suitable for us and will it bring us more trouble than convenience. After all, we need a tool to bring my family out and most family have a car, most people won&apos;t buy a car if there is less advantage than disadvantage.       I drove 30 KM with my wife and son. It was easy to drive a automatic car although I haven&apos;t drive a car by myself after I got driver license. It&apos;s more comfortable, safety and boring than drive a motocycle. The next is taught my wife driving and plan our spring trip. I must bring us some freely trip in the future.

The drizzle ended this morning. It is much colder and more like the winter. In the warm comforable bed, I find it hard getting up. After repeating to myself that I would be late to work, I got up unwillingly. On my way to the subway station, I was splashed by some muddy water from a pond nearby when a car just passed by. Dear lord. This unexpected experience made me not good. Because of the thinking on the mess of muddy spots on my clothes, I was so disattracted that I forgot my umbrella which was left on the subway. Dear lord again. It had accompained me for almost two years.The good news is those spots are not that strong. After cleanazing with some water, they are gone. Anyway I am bessed. By saying farewell to my dear umbrella, I should buy a new one.</p>
