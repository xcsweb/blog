In this way, they trust me more and more, they are also willing to buy some insurance or some finance products from me. so my track record has been good. The more you do it, the more daring you get, due to all of stocks i was bought before are rise. i decide buy much more stocks with all the money I’ve saved. but you can imagine the result. the stocks declined.my mama said to me on the phone, you have not back home for two years, your father and i are very miss you. you must be back this year whatever happends.the new year is coming soon, but i even no money to buy ticket. fortunately, the bank paid the salary and bonus in advance. i bring the twenty thousand RMB get on the train home.dad tell me a good news as soon as i get home, GOV plans build a new hight way right across our house.

As everybody knows, we must obey general regulation such as collective activity. Taking at least a group photo is necessary, of course, keeping on this culture is one of welfare to us especially in economic downturn outside. What&apos;s more, the pay raise of this year finally is fixed today and it will be presented in next month salary. For us, it&apos;s really a good new, because it&apos;s everybody expected. Currently, I am not sure how percent can increase this year, but, no matter how percent can be given, it&apos;s always better than nothing. I also believe if we failed to pay raise this year that means a large group of people will be left here at the beginning of next year. As one of corporate culture, we are always shorthanded, in a word, we must have the ability to take multitasks at the same time. On one hand, we can learn a lot than other company, on the other hand, we can&apos;t do a very good performance on one case even it&apos;s very important case.The actual situation is not allowed to focus on one case for a long time. Absolutely, to earn the salary is not an easy job, we have to sustain big pressure from the internal or external.    So, I told myself if I no longer can&apos;t bear the stress around me one day, I have to prepare a backup before quitting job here.But, also I hope I can insist in there for longer time

<p>Greeting and chatting with the friend, He almost forgot<br>the main purpose for coming, Tiger found two goods in the sick room he has<br>never seen before. One is the glasses which is very weird with a hat, other one<br>is the mini overhead projector. He was told by the doctor there are almost 80 %<br>people have suffering the neck and the waist disease for our ages, this two<br>things can help you watching TV on the bed instead of sitting somewhere was easy<br>for the your body.</p>
<p>He showed me the photos he was taken for those and<br>wanted me to buy for him immediately. It was hard to see clear what’s it? What’s<br>the brand? You know the man is much different with woman, he was not good at describe<br>what he wanted only with unclear photo, I am not quite sure what is the new goods<br>in market even I just heard, I had to find the needle from the sea patiently<br>which is more popular right now.</p>
<p>The glasses is easy for me to find out according to my<br>imagination, and it is not very expensive, done for one. But there are many<br>kinds of brands for the projector, Gimi is the one can link with Mi Box system,<br>Shen Hua looks very elegant with the shelf, the price is little expensive than<br>Gimi, the function is more flexible, I learned it from supplier step by step to<br>fully understand what the new thing is, how to link with Ipad, cell phone and<br>computer.</p>
<p>Yesterday it was delivered and we cannot wait to open<br>the pack, Tiger was very smart to install it smoothly under my direction. Which<br>is very portable, Automation focusing, Clear image, Gaming and Videos are amazing,<br>it is really change my mind there is a new time coming, there must be some old<br>digital stuffs will be replaced, so we have to learn the new things and follow<br>the step forward, otherwise we will be lost by this young generation.</p>

So I love to record things and beautiful views by a camera instead writting for many years.  But now, photos can&apos;t exciting me as before after 3 cameras are retired.      Now, I love to draw somethings on my sketch book although it need a lot of time and I&apos;m not good at it.  I can find the speciall beauty from a drawing rather than photo.  I begin to understand why the photo can&apos;t replace the drawing and others arts.  It may be sample, colourless, disproportinate or abstract, but all that can&apos;t cover the beauty of a drawing.  And we can feel it better when we drawing it by us.  I always see things by line and colour rather than a object.  I want to draw it down when I see some beautiful  building or view.     Most of my friends think it&apos;s amazing for a staightforward northern man to sit down and have a drawing. But I love drawing and enjoy myself by that.

<p>Agriculture exhibition centre is located in third ring<br>road, the place for is one of famous Annual fairs every year in the Beijing, because<br>of it is not too far from our living. So we had the appointment to be there<br>this morning. After security checking and Scan ID you can access for the qualification<br>only, no need any tickets, I remembered we had to found the tickets first<br>either from the internet or buying from street vendors at the last few years<br>before. Right now everything is getting normalization.</p>
<p>I was a little early than others, so I went around the<br>counters first, the atmosphere of Spring Festival came to my face, the red<br>copybook at everywhere, there were a lot of fruits, wine, coffee, seafood,<br>everything inside, the assistant of the seller spoke louder with the microphone,<br>he wanted you stop their counter to taste the foods for a while, for sure they did<br>not force you to buy, just gave them the support for popularity. Frankly speaking<br>before you go to the fair, you don’t need have the breakfast, tasting this and<br>that including drinking the coffee or coconut milk, or have the sausage, before<br>my friend’s coming, I have full already. </p>
<p>I prefer to buy instant foods, smoked fish, Jelly<br>fish, and abalone which are very easy for cooking. Tell you the truth, go to<br>the fair, you can bargain with the seller, especially for bundling sales. If 100<br>for three bags is the quotation, at least you can get it four or five bags in<br>100 yuan finally.</p>
<p>One hour later the bags were full, two hands were occupied,<br>We hate that we did not take a cart for hand carry, everything we wanted to<br>buy, just abilities not equal my ambitious. </p>
<p>Very good experience at the fair, I took many photos<br>to share with you here.</p>

Also called the Duanwu Festival, is celebrated on the fifth day<br>of the fifth month according to the Chinese calendar, people always eat rice dumplings<br>and watch dragon boat races.</p>
<p>Three days holiday including the weekend of the<br>festival for this year, I suggested to my family going picnic in the park during<br>the holiday, due to the beginning of summer is not too hot, far away to crowd<br>people, and I have prepared the tent, the air pillow, outdoor chairs and tables<br>in advance, I believe this outdoor activity is happy for the child and released<br>the pressure for young mother and father. As expected my idea was really<br>welcomed.</p>
<p>The first day of the holiday was a nice day, it was not<br>too hot with a little cloudy, My family were going to Olympic park where was<br>not too far from my home, full of car with our stuffs including foods and<br>beverages, luckily we came more early, we found a very good place on green<br>grass of the ground, after confirmed with gardener where was allowed for<br>packing tent, everyone was busy for the new house, the new tent is much better<br>than my old one, it was easy to packing, the baby was playing his bike, my daughter<br>was making Sandwich, my daughter in law was fixing the tent, I was busy with<br>the folding chair and table, only Tiger was nothing to do, only waiting<br>everything was ready for his study. There were water melon, cherry, cucumber and<br>bread hand carry from home, Chicken feet with pickled pepper which is one of my<br>daughter favourite food I did it by myself.</p>
<p>The blue sky with a little white cloud, the green<br>grass, I took one sunhat to Tiger, the young parent was playing ball with the<br>baby, I was enjoying myself shooting, everything is relax and happy. How harmonious<br>feeling at the moment! We will come again for sure. Before we left there were more<br>families with their tent as well, I hope this kind of life can be taken longer<br>till the end of the world. </p>

Every year our friends for<br>sure would not miss the chance in Beijing. We have been to many famous places<br>at this season, so this year we went to Badaling national forest Park in suburbs<br>of Beijing, Red hill is the nice colourful picture you will see.</p>
<p>We checked the weather of the day one week ago, and we<br>planned to go there green commuting and stagger the rush hour, so we went out<br>9am to take the subway first and then transfer to the special vehicle. We were<br>surprised that the ticker seller gave us very details information for the<br>scenic area even her voice was too loud and noisy, including the time of final<br>bus for the return, the better way of good view of the mountain and you might<br>go by foot or by cable car. So it was very caring for the new comers.</p>
<p>Ms Jiang Li is our captain in our group, due to she is<br>always the organiser for the outing, She would like doing very details plan for<br>any tours of us, the address, the transportation, the accommodation and control<br>the time and safe, some time she was the driver, she was quite smart for using<br>the digital equipment, she like taking her sheltie stick for the group picture,<br>and also taking her smart camera which taking the photo are more colourful and<br>clear. I can see without her outing will not have so fresh and meaningful.</p>
<p>The park is not so high mountain with all stairs, it<br>is easy for all kind of people coming, a little cloudy of the day, only till<br>the lunch time there are some white clouds hanging of the blue sky, we should<br>thank the day for our outing and shooting, the good view of the red maple<br>leaves are all in the back side of mountain, Great wall to be the back ground into<br>our eyes, some green, yellow, golden and red colour are mixing together, very<br>great and beautiful, just like needlework on the cloth picture, we did not<br>missing any corners for shooting or videos to record the wonderful moments. I<br>believe if you come here, you would forget any unhappy things around you and<br>you will have smiling face to the people around you always. </p>
