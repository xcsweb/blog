The sun is over there in the universe. Now it is covered by clouds and I can not see it for the time being. For months, the sun has not come out frequently. On the contrary, it rains a lot. Tomorrow is said to be rainy again. It has no sign the rain will stop soon.The abnormality of the weather tells us of the truth that we have to follow the god. At least right now, we still have to face the reality that we are not totally able to to make everything on our own. Since we are part of the earth and the universe. The extreme climate influences us a lot, not only on the aspects of our lives but also the productivity in industries, such as farming, fishing and so forth.The fact is the sun is always there.

She talks to a strange man sitting at the next table.“—Excuse me,… It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you do me a favor? Would you mind looking after my luggage for a short while? … I just need to quickly exchange my money.””—Sure. I don’t mind looking after your luggage….”This is a scene of an English teaching film. What I’d like to say is, it does not happen in real life because we couldn’t trust any stranger.It is dangerous to ask a stranger to do you a favor, especially letting someone look after your luggage or watch over your children. Because there are a lot of important things such as some valuable supplies, precious materials and some certificates. So we don’t suggest that you ask some stranger to do something for you. Besides, your children are  not ‘objects’, so they can’t be entrusted to others.  It is also dangerous if you want to help others who are too active especially one who acts enthusiastically and excessively because you will be misunderstood by others. You will be suspected as s cheater most possibly.As the economic society is developing, the whole society turn into complex, more and more. People’s thoughts and lives are not pure and simple no longer. Kindness and wickedness exist at the same time and at the same pace. We are busy on our important things, without spirit, energy and time to identify these kindness and wickedness. So we prefer to do everything by ourselves. We couldn’t believe others. We can only believe and trust ourselves. Corrected by Teacher Chawee</p>

I had my motocycle for more than five years, but it almost been ideled in the past 4 years because my work and life. I always doubt that if I will keep it.      The advantages of the motocycle:1.  It&apos;s cool, freedom and exciting.             My moto cycle is cheaper but have the similar type with the Halley-davision motocycle.  It&apos;s beautiful and cool to ride to across the road. Ridding motocycle is closed way with ridding a horse,  you can feel the warm or cool wind blow through your body and smell all the smell along the  road,  you&apos;re a part of the nature when you riding a motocycle.  You won&apos;t feel that in a car,  that make me exciting. 2. It&apos;s powerful and convenient.           I had been ridding bicycle for 2 years, but the longgest distance I can reached is 40KM away. And it&apos;s a hard thing to ride a bicycle. I always worried the electric volumn when I have to go a long distance by an electrical bike , although it is convenient.    And I don&apos;t want to try to find a parking space for a car where the traffic is heavy.  On the contrary, motocycle can bring me to everyplace if I want and have enough time.  10L gaslion is enough to support a 500KM long running.  And it is easy to park it in everywhere.    The disadvantages1. It&apos;s dangerous.      It&apos;s more dangerous to ride a motocycle than drive a car, ride a bicycle or electric bike.  It has a heavy weight and high speed, So it&apos;s not easy to stop in an emergency.  I have fallen down for more than 5 times, and one of them is very dangerous.  So I don&apos;t want to bring my family members  any more when I ride motocycle.  It&apos;s easier to get hurt wnen an accident happen.2. Motocycles are limited in many place.      Motocycles are limited in many cities especially in the center areas of the city. We can&apos;t running in a highway and eleated road . And we always be discrimnations by the policy and people.       I don&apos;t want to leave the motocycle although there are so many disadvantages.  Because is the rare different things in my ordinary life which make me exciting and different. The motocycle is a hobby more than a tool.  Maybe I will get a job closed to my home next year and have more time to ride it. And I always hope to have long distance journey with my motocycle.  In a word, I don&apos;t bear to give it up.

Is it born<br>within e very person’s heart, but has to be cultivated. A person without humor<br>is just like a spring without flowers, or like a dish without seasoning. In a<br>sense, your personality lies in your sense of humor.</p>
<p>Humor can improve physical as well as mental<br>well-being. It helps us bear our burdens, lessen our tension, overcome our<br>frustration. With a piece of joke, all our worries and sadness disappear like<br>smoke, and we are full of vigor once again. </p>
<p>Humor helps us live in harmony with others. It<br>is unavoidable to have misunderstanding and tension with others during work and<br>study. But humor can ease these problems quicker than angry words or quarrels.<br>With it you can always keep on good terms with others.</p>
<p>Humor appears to be an important part of human survival. The<br>ability to laugh can dispel tension, for example, while an understanding of<br>complex situations can help people to make good decisions. People with a<br>well-developed sense of humor appear to be happier in psychological studies,<br>and some are healthier as well, suggesting that it may just be good for you.</p>
<p>Older people can also enhance this ability by paying attention<br>to ways in which humor manifests around them. Some people simply have a unique<br>or odd sense of humor which needs a little bit of encouragement to flourish,<br>especially if it is subtle. Asking friends to explain funny situations or jokes<br>after the fact can be informative, as can watching comedy shows and reading<br>jokes, humor columns, and funny novels.</p>
<p>I think most of people has the sense of humor<br>is nature heavenly, only some of them has to educate and learn from others,<br>maybe follow their parents or friends, and to be a funny guy making people<br>happy. I like the people with cold humor, the meaning is that looking like a<br>little serious face, kindly heart with glasses, I don’t like he / she tries never<br>to offend anybody, he/ she doesn’t talk too much, just listen others more first<br>when talking something each other, he / she has the clear mind to tell something<br>logical thinking with rich knowledge. This kind of humor is my appreciated and I<br>admire that I can be the one in someday later.</p>
<p>A sense of humor is really one of keys to<br>happiness. It gives fun and zest to life to make it worth living.</p>

Those agony, worries and grief unconsciously seemed to varnish into thin air as I typing something. At present, I am turning the valve in the first freezing day of Beijing. Before I prepared to face the arrival of cold day, I unexpectedly got two following pictures from Rongcheng ,Shandong which allowed me to feel how different in winter between seaside city and Beijing. Among deep snow stands a lone pavilion, one is impossible to tell how far and vast the sea, and enjoy the grandeur of sea under blue sky. The only thing that penetrated  into the heart and eyes is endless gray and white. It sharpened the sense of cold and turned out into a coolness that crept upon my backbone, I had to leave the laptop and walk away for a while.     The picture furthermore set off a chilling weather and impressed us how different the sea in the summer and winter. In most cases, most people are obsessed with the landscape of sea under a summer day, but  noticed the sea in winter. I am sure, the picture would discourage most prospective tourists if it appeared on the portal website of tourism agency. </p>

The abnormality implies another potential snow.This night is the longest night in a year and tomorrow days are getting longer and longer which will end its longest day on the Summer Solstice every year. In less than ten days, the year 2019 is coming. How days fly without any information. Whatever, we are getting on. What can we do to prevent that? A youg heart, a posiive mind, or a well planned scheme? It depends on what we see and what we want.Winter solstice is the day of tomb sweeping for many people.

A TED speaker once said that you need something within your control and something could stay in your control when there were so many things that couldn’t. To me, it is learning. As an inseparable part of my life, it gives me routine and stability when I am dealing with so much uncertainty in life.  To say that I had a marked uptick in my English learning is incredibly soothing. But the word was chosen less for that than the sheer variety of results it has lead to, from my writing skills thanks to my daily karaoke, to my abilities of handling pressures, which I’ve learnt from the schoold of hard knocks, to my scope of the knowledge, that I’ve broaden from books, jobs, and even day-to-day life. Other words on the short list suggest that the year 2018 is one of the worst, while “learn” is the key that I have not beatened down by life. And now I have a strong feeling that next year’s winner would be something great, like “Success”, “Confidence” or “Lucky”.</p>

It almost reached my limited that I can endure, fortunately, the National Day is coming then I can relax a short time. The most busy days will be on at the end of October and it is a terrible period our team and I will be going through. Everyone knows that we are always shorthanded and require the ability of handling multitasks at the same time, no doubt, it will provide us opportunities to showing off in front of big boss, but, the challenge is you will be keeping on going and always full of energy. It is not everyone can handle it, I think I still have a long way to go for the new role in this project, not only fearing my English if can communicate with customer, also worrying my working style if can suit this position. I already prepared to take this test no matter the result is good or bad, I would like to give a shot to test myself if can go on this way jumping out of comfort zone. If I always satisfy my current working content, I will lose further ascending space in company.    Anyway, I should fight for this chance. Change is hard at first, messy in the middle and so gorgeous at the end.
