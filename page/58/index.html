Absolutely, it is the time to have coat. I have my shirt with long sleeves from this week. Just last weekend, I had T-shirt. This trending speeds the leaves to fall down and more deciduous trees will have the autumn style by changing green leaves into red and yellow color. The enthusiasm of life never ends regardless of season changing. When I run, I feel cool by sweating on the way. At the first beginning, I sense a little bit cold, but I just feel the warmth from the heart beating and do not find it hard to move any more further as long as I want to run.I rarely have a cold. The main reason  I assume is that I exercise regularly. And I believe the truth life really lies in movement. If you rest a lot, you terribly rust.</p>

We can<br>see its everywhere including TV shows, the lawyer helps the divorce family trying<br>to be settle their house, children and all property in legally.</p>
<p>The parents divorced when the child is in elementary<br>school, this divorce disrupted the childhood in serious ways. Indeed, even<br>today it is difficult for the child to admit that their parents are divorced,<br>If divorce has so deeply affected one person, consider the harmful effects divorce<br>must be having on society as a whole.</p>
<p>The little girl woke from a nightmare. She ran to her parent’s<br>room to see her father so he could comfort her. Then she suddenly remembered<br>that he was no longer living with her. Her parents were divorced. She began to<br>shake and cry. Divorce has greatly affected this child. </p>
<p>One of my relatives was divorced when their daughter<br>at the school time, right now she has been graduated and worked for some years.<br>But she is afraid to marry; her personality is unsocial and refused to find any<br>boyfriends, her mother promised keep herself single in her life, so the divorce<br>has been changed their minds from the original. But for her father, even he has<br>married again with a younger woman, but for sure the divorce was bringing more experiences<br>in his life.</p>
<p>Of every four couples who marry in United States, one<br>will seek divorce. In some urban areas, the figure is even higher, as many as<br>half the marriage in Los Angeles area end in divorce. This means that there is<br>an increasing number of single-parent households and of children living without<br>one of their parents, Consider that harmful effects divorce seems to be having<br>on society.</p>
<p>One hundred years ago, an unhappy couple simply lived<br>unhappily or tried to work out their problems, Divorce was an option that was<br>never considered. Today, an unhappy couple easily decides that divorce is the<br>answer to their problems. However, consider the harmful effect these easy<br>divorces seem to be having on society.</p>
<p>Any society has many problems. The society in any<br>countries is no exception. Some of the problems that the people must deal with<br>are drugs, unemployment, welfare, and the generation gap. However, the basic<br>problem is the changing structure of the family, which causes an over whelming<br>number of divorces, Consider the harmful effects divorce is having on the<br>people in the world.</p>

I signed to be a member for many years, and I always recommened the Dioenglish to my colleagues and friends.  But I found they have to pay 100yuan to be a member for new comers now.  I know it&apos;s not easy to run such a website. But it&apos;s strange to be a number with money in China. After all, there are not too many contents have to pay for the copyright in the website.  The 100 yuan will keep a lot of English lovers out of the webset.  More members will help the website growing better.  Some ads is OK for me to cover the cost of the website.       There are more and more english lovers will want to be a member of the website according with the english studying upsurge.  A free membership maybe a better choice.  Hope the website have a better future and last foever.

Since He resisted the<br>operation for his waist, after we got the good advice by a very famous doctor, and<br>we don’t want to take any risks for the operation, even we knew some good<br>doctors or professors in medical field. So at the last, the conservative treatment<br>was the way at the moment we told after they read the reports from his unclear<br>magnetic.</p>
<p>Introduced by his sister, we came to Health recovery<br>centre where is located at the west part of Beijing, it is health resort near<br>the mountain, the place is not too big with a few buildings, a covered antique corridor<br>with a colourful painting, like a gallery, the different green pine trees<br>making is like a park, many of people can take the walk with long corridor, you<br>can see many of wheel chairs at the corner to take the sunshine from the<br>morning to the evening, very quiet to enjoying the sunset, it is really<br>beautiful place you can relax totally.</p>
<p>We lived a suite at third floor with two beds with the<br>sunshine, Luckily we are VIP guests as they said, order the dishes as per menu<br>one day in advance, at the next day the girl is taking the food to your room directly,<br>Like Room Service, very convenient for living there. Each shift of nurses would<br>come to your room say hello to each room before starting their works. Very curtsey<br>and helpful.  </p>
<p>Tiger goes to the treatment centre for almost two hours<br>every morning and afternoon including Wax nursing, physical treatment, hot compress<br>bag and traction therapy, in order to get well soon, Tiger took it very<br>seriously and follow the instruction for each items carefully.</p>
<p>I was fully in charge his accommodation including his eating,<br>cleaning and sleeping during these days, I like calling myself a baby-sitter 24<br>hours totally. A common vision for us like him relaxing during the time. As we<br>all know it needs the time at least three months recovery smooth in bed as much<br>as you can, don’t be worry, there is no short tips for the separate part of body.</p>
<p>This weekend we have checked out the hospital, the<br>nurses and doctors were all very kind and good service they had, they all came<br>to see good bye to us and they were standing one side when we were leaving. I<br>am the hoteller, so it is a really five star hospital service I have never seen<br>before. We had a good time during my stay. </p>

What’s more, this kind of weather will last for the end of weekend according to the latest forecast so that I had to get up half an hour earlier to avoid traffic jam, it may cause by warm temperature, I am not sure whether it causes by warm temperature that doesn’t go against the haze dispel. I knew some kindergarten school even primary school already cancelled the morning exercises to reduce the exposed time in haze and also as temporary measure the government ordered some factories which caused air pollution temporary stopping production.Recently, as the increasing of air pollution and water pollution, the environment protection was put on the agenda, but how to keep the balance between economic development and environment was really a big topic in front of us……</p>

Just a couple of days ago, it was still not that cold. It is amost at zero degree right now. It is said to snow till tomorrow noon. Large snowflakes are dancing in the air, the white world is becoming quiet. This is the best gift for this winter.Apart from the tea and book, I look through the window and am fascinated by the tranquility and purification of snowing. That is amazing. Such kind of a sudden snow does surprise people a lot. Largely it does not ofen snow in winter. Most guys are over the moon. Kids are even ecstatically about it since they rarely meet that before. They do not care if their clothes are wet or not. With snow their happiness of childhood is just that simple and true.Now few guys are around the West Lake. When it ends, it would be another view of groups of tourists. Another live of moments on Wechat is on the way. We can not help uploading pictures of snow right there to share the exciting feelings and moments with friends.It really makes me easy and fully enjoy this weekend.</p>

It<br>describes parents hover over their kids at home and at the playground like a helicopter.<br>Today modern technology allows these helicopter parents to hover from even far<br>away. They can give their children direction at any moment from anywhere. </p>
<p>Many authors have written books about how to<br>raise an adult: break free of over parenting trap and prepare your kids to<br>success, and how to see the checking list the students in the school, are they<br>are really good students with high score in the class? Why helicopter parents<br>is bad for your teen’s health.</p>
<p>Recently I am watching TV “A Little Reunion”,<br>it is talking about three families with high school students who will be going<br>to university entrance examination, One of family they are helicopter parents,<br>they force the kids study hard and study after the class, putting the end of<br>their interests, let the little hearts of them are less of hope for their<br>future, no communication with parents. Right now I am not talking about our government<br>education way is good or not, in most of parent’s eyes, the entrance<br>examination is the only way for the young students to open their career bridge,<br>that’s why they have to do many things are going beyond the limit to the kids. As<br>we all know that some of western countries have entertainment education, no<br>much home works for students, the parents are focus on their interests to train<br>as their friends.</p>
<p>I am so proud of my daughter she is smart and<br>very intelligent, during her school time, Tiger and I did not give her any<br>pressure for study, for sure I am not a helicopter parents and I believe she<br>had the happy and relax childhood till she became a post graduate student. </p>

This is to end the smog for the time being and another round of temperature reduction soon comes after the rain. It could be the gift for the beginning of December. It washes out the dust and brightens everything. How fast it is. December reminds me of the new year 2019 which is about to arrive around the corner. Everything looks like extraordinarily normal. But there are still something we have to be ready. One of the most important things is to plan for the new year. The second one is to conclude what exactly we have done this year. If not, we just live everyday hit or miss. Everyday in the morning, I wake up from the twitter of the birds. They always sing happily. The noisy world is none of their business. It could be that simple. In the rain, they are hilariously holding a concert. I do not know where they hide in those trees but the singing tells me of their existence. </p>
