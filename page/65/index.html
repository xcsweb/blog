To be frank, I never worry about my weight, because I always think the weight is not a big problem to a man as long as the weight is not over standard too much. Based on this kind of mindset, I seldom control my daily diet even when I eat too much at night and comfort myself that it will be fine, I just occasionally eat a little bit than normal. All these result in my weight that goes far away standard too much, even one of my close friends persuades me to go on a diet in a way. Today, I put myself on the scale to check whether I really gain weight a lot, absolutely, I do put on weight of five kilograms during the past six months. That it is also surprise myself a lot. What&apos;s wrong with me? I don&apos;t feel liking eating more than usual, why I still gain weight a lot? Do I eat too much high-calorie food over the dinner? After keeping calm, I thought the main reason is because I recently have a good appetite with less exercise. Normally, my daily walking steps are no more than five-thousands, so if I want to lose weight in the new year of 2019, I have to take some effective measures to prevent trend getting worse, as the temporary measure, I think the best method is to go on diet, because I don&apos;t think I can lose weight by exercise.     With the approach of 2019, I have to make a flag as one of my resolutions of 2019 is to realize the target of losing weight of five kilograms at the end of 2019.

Some of people may measure their happiness in<br>brands and show their success with selfies. My friends take a lot of selves and<br>won’t hang out with people hotter than her. But I love selfies, love<br>photographs, I like sharing my happiness with others, I like going out with my<br>friends who are beautiful or not, as long as we have many topics to talk and<br>more simple mind to deal with.</p>
<p>Nothing silently shrieks loneliness more than<br>posting a photo of you taken with a phone in your mirror, but I don’t think so,<br>when I have a good mood with my new hair style or a new dresses, I would like<br>taking a self shooting for myself to record the moment, when I was old in some<br>day later, I have never regret to take more young pictures as I do now, because<br>Time never goes back, that’s why I have many selfies in my cell phone in different<br>post, and most of them after beauty cam.</p>
<p>Some of people said the photo after beauty cam<br>is cheating others, and lost the natural. In my opinion, find out the photo for<br>what reason? if it is official use or blind dating, or chatting on the<br>internet, it is for special reasons, maybe the result is out of your control. For<br>me I do it only for my love, for my own records. One of my good said posting<br>too many selfies can put off potential suitor, explaining that they may think<br>that you are self – absorbed or very narcissistic and refrain from approaching<br>you. So I have seldom to send the photos in my space unless it has emerged to<br>capture memorable moments, they can mark reunions with family, intimate<br>moments, with your beloved, and good times shared with friends.</p>
<p>At the last week, I have learned how to take<br>the self photo in 3 seconds in cam. The meaning you can have the time to ready yourself<br>before you press the bottom, please have a look the photo with my mom to try<br>with new function I learned, No body believe it was taken by myself, right?</p>

I usually felt upset during the past weeks, even I don&apos;t feel like doing anything especially in daily work. But, when I calm down, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s necessary to be angry with someone regrading something. The pressure is always existence in working, I need learn to balance it between working and life. Some pressure from inside, because I am not enough powerful to deal with tricky things and also some pressure from outside that is caused by objective cause that I can do nothing about it. As the growth of age, I find myself has a tendency to solidify and don&apos;t want to learn something new. One of my weakness is to keep in my comfort zone and never has the desire to do something each day that moves out of my comfort zone to improve myself. I know if I keep this mind continually, I will put myself into very dangerous situation, because, the outsider environment is full of competition. I will be obsolete quickly if I still don&apos;t want to try something new.    I hope I can get a good performance not only in working but in my daily life. From this time, I should open my mind to try accepting and learning for better life tomorrow.

If you are really into it, you find it, then you can never easily get out of it. When one of these guys won in that play of mahjong, he definitely felt great and excited. And other gamblers were surely to try winning back. The experience of rush of adrenaline due to the cause of winning in a game is quite amazing. It makes the winner feel high in the sky.

Then it was quiet in the office. Though it will still rain on this weekend, it won’t be that cold and the mild wind has told the arrival of spring. I quite like this moment since I can view the beauty of nature. By undressing the veil of winter, verdant trees, grass and flowery blossoms happily display their naive and cute appearance.The truth of living in this world is to keep a peaceful mind. Meanwhile experience is the best friend which is with us that we can judge and analyse what is the next step we can move on. This kind of simple principle we hardly remember. We only forget many things that we feel not that important. As a matter of fact, every tiny little story of llife could be a lesson.</p>

The event<br>would be hold at SKP Beijing where is her company, and this is the final<br>competition after select 300 participants, due to her relationship our baby<br>would not take the first round, direct into the final game. That’s why she wanted<br>us to cheer for our baby at the day.</p>
<p>Balance bike is kind of bike without step plate and it<br>is only for baby, right not it very popular, you can see it everywhere in<br>playground. As we were told there were many qualification babies who have taken<br>the professional class only for this kind of bike to join the event of the day.<br>So this match must be a splendid party, let our baby to take more chances to<br>see and open his eye instead of only staying at home before go to kindergarten.</p>
<p>There were four groups by age, for 2-3 years old group<br>is the first group would be starting at 9.30am at Yesterday, one by one is<br>going at set the circuit with four kind of obstacle blocks, the baby has to go through<br>without any helps, the faster is to be winner. Xiao Bao likes the bike so much,<br>this is one of his favourite toys, as long as any outings he prefers to ride<br>it, and the bike is safer then walking or running for 2 and half years old baby,<br>maybe he asked for hug shamelessly if everyone is around him. So any obstacle on<br>the way he has can do it well and easily, I do believe Xiao Bao can be complete<br>the match for sure.</p>
<p>There are about 20 babies and their parents have been<br>checked in at the counter, Ours is Number 2, lucky number, the sticker of number<br>should be sticking on each bike before register, seems everything is<br>professional, the scene is very living and vivid with disco music, due to some<br>sunshine boys was playing street dance and hip-hop to encourage babies has good<br>performance.</p>
<p>I was ready to be the photo photographer at the site<br>to record the great moment during him perform, after the host said to start,<br>Xiao Bao was so handsome with his helmet go out from starting point sharply, I<br>did not see any afraid from his face, each of blocks on the way he did very<br>freely, seemed that he understood he must be hard work, he was really not a baby,<br>he was a big boy, I was so exciting to move my camera and following his figure<br>slowly to record, after he crossed the final line smoothly, the cheer up and<br>the round applause by audience for him was so loud and exciting.</p>
<p>The result is not so important thing for them. In fact,<br>what you have got from the game that you took part in is most important than, I<br>do believe he and my daughter learned a lots from it, I hope more and more<br>babies and their family would think about it, trying to take more chances like<br>this. Every baby to participate has the medal after event, which is the first<br>medal for him in his life; hopefully he will get more medals in the future.</p>

There are two medicine drawers at my home;<br>one is for Tiger which has three or four kinds of medicines only on daily<br>basis, due to he has the high blood pressure and terrible heart disease. I<br>cannot image if he suddenly fell ill by heart attack, it would be very dangerous<br>for his live. So for him no matter where we go, packing medicine is a very<br>important issue, and not one to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>According to the currently policy of employee,<br>almost 80-90% expense paid by insurance company for ordinary citizen for a year.<br>My previous company is not bad for the staff benefits. Luckily each of employee<br>are entitle to have the second reimbursement of medicine expense after paid by the<br>insurance, that meaning I can reimburse basic on your actual payment. What I am<br>trying to say is I almost have nothing expense for a year unless some special<br>cases. Tiger’s company is the private company; it does not have such good welfare<br>for the staff. So all the expenses of Tiger is under my name, this is not<br>cheating, many of couple doing like it, due to the doctors who never care who<br>is the patient or not, as long as getting the medicine from their hospital or<br>getting the commission.</p>
<p>I regularly get the medicines from the small community<br>clinic near my home; the doctor is only responsible for making a prescription.<br>I prefer to prepare some basic medicines. </p>
<p>Medicine drawer has to be clear up often, most<br>of the medicines were only one or two years expired. Yesterday I made up the<br>medicine drawers to prepare some for my next traveling and also clear up stacks<br>of pills expired. So I can say who is diligent or not at home, you can check<br>their medicine drawer. This is easily taken out by the date.</p>
