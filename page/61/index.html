I didn’t how many times I went in and out of it this year, I lost count. I guess, this times it’s the last straw and I might not able to handle it. Still I sent my son to his weekend school, and I finished daily learning at a teahouse.  That’s the only way to diverse my attentions, and I needed that—diversion. There was a hospital admission certificate in my pocket. It’s so damn heavy. “Nerve Deafness” on it seemed to have poisonous sting and was like jumping out of the paper to bite me the very next minute.  The doctor said I need to be in hospital for four days’ treatment. Drug won’t help so hospital admission became necessary. I didn’t know what to do.  My mum called. She was worried when she checked my son’s GPS and found that we were in hospital. She said she could get my son to her home during that time. And she also suggested that I breath deeply to fix it.  It didn’t make me feel better. It made me feel silly because I was worried about something that could be fixed by deep breath. And I was also not sure it was a good idea to send my son to mom’s home. With final exam coming, my son needs discipline and supervisor, my mum would be the least person to provide that. So I hung up the phone.  I also hung up my husband’s phone. I need some time to breath, to pretend that I was totally Okay with that.  After arriving home, mess in the kitchen and a giant couch potato. After sending my son to bed, I collapsed.  My husband tried to comfort me, I guess he really tried but all his efforts backfired. He tried to tell me that it was not a big deal, he was much worsen but he got it through, and I should not stress myself with learning, and I had no life at all, I should learn to relax.  I didn’t feel better and I felt worse. Because every word he said was telling me what a loser I am. And then he lost his temper: “I just felt a little better and you got to ruin this! What do you want me to do? Okay, its all my fault. Do you need me to kill myself to apologize?” I rushed out of the door. It’s childish, it’s so not grown-up. But so what?  It was chilly outside. How strange, for a person who is going deaf, the world is so noisy. Nothing has left except the drumming in the ear. What would happen, if one day everything else is drowning in that noise? It was scary. Why shouldn’t I be entitled to be scared?  What do I need? A hug, a warm hug, without a word, without any judgment and comment, a hug to silence that noise in the ear—that’s enough. Was I asking too much? </p>

<p>Ling shui is in southeast of Hai Nan, I was the first<br>time to be there even I have come to Hai Nan a few times before, on my<br>understanding, any places near the sea must be wet and humid, washing clothe is<br>hard to get the dry in one day, but Ling Shui is the good place, it has the nice<br>view and it is not too many people, the people in the seaside is only the<br>residents of the community and the hotel guests. During my stays, I went to the<br>seaside at the early morning around 6.30am every day, I like to taste the feel<br>of the sea, I watched the sun rising on the horizon far away, it’s like a red<br>ball of fire, it makes everything around us look very beautiful, I was playing<br>the water and running in and out to the sea in make different poses with my<br>friends. We wanted to record any moments by photos and videos and it were all<br>arrested by our youth change future, The event picture was just directly in our<br>faces, we forgot the time to be there, the coastline likes a big prawn very<br>clearly to say hello to everyone there. I cannot control myself to recite one<br>poem “ Say goodbye again to Cambridge”, my friend took the record quietly at<br>the side. How lovely the sea and my friends! Because of you accompany with me<br>always, the life makes it beautiful. I love you all forever.</p>

We have two choices ,continuing to stay at home and taking a trip. If we stay at home, it is comfortable and there is no need to spend money. But in that case, we will learn little about the world.If we go on a trip, we can broaden our view and gain knowledge we cannot get from books. Some of our friends suggest that we should go to places of interest nearby. I think that it is a good idea. It does not cost much, yet we can still learn a lot. Moreover, my babies are too young to take a long journey. So I want to go to the beach with my family. I think in the next few days I should make a plan for our trip and prepare some necessary  things. At the present time, I am expect to enjoy the upcoming trip with my family. So much for today!</p>

The topic of my speech is the innovation and speed, the arrival of AI era.  We all know that the AI was so popular now.  Let&apos;s talk about that too.       The content of my speech.  first, the defination the AI;  Second , Why do we need AI;  Third, possible applications of AI in USI.  Fourth, How can individuals adapt to the AI era.       AI, the full name is Artificial Intelligence. It&apos;s the simulate of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systerms.  There are two main branches of AI. One is weak or narrow AI, Which can learn and operation with the help of human.  Such as chatbots, robotics automation and self-driving car.  The other is strong AI or AGI.  In which machines and software that is conscious and has a mind .  The first robotic citizen sophia maybe the beginning of the strong AI.    Why do we need AI.    First is the labor cost. As shown in the right picture. The average monthly salary in Shang hai has rised 135 times in the past 40 years. And it will rise continuously. That&apos;s one reason for our industry transformation.     On the contrary, AI technology can provide machines which can work even 24 hours a day and more efficient work. They are no tired , no absent minded and no complain. They can bring us high output and low cost.     Third is the product update cycle is shortened.   We need rapid development and quick response. AI can help us on that.      forth is the more accurate produts and higher quality.  According with the technology development our product get smaller and smaller,  more requirement and less defect. most of them can&apos;t be handle by human beings or it&apos;s great expensive.

<li>Then is the possible applications of AI in USI.   fist is product design. It include PCB design, PCBA design mold design and so on.  it alway takes a third or more times of a product development cycle.  Maybe the AI may help us to save more than 95% works in the future.    Material handing.  The main manufacture process was done by machine. But the material handing still handing by human.  The machine just do part of the inspection and testing work.  and people have to do the rest.  Following the AI technology development , more and more work will be done by machine.    The manufacturing execution systerm can link and control all the manufactur process. It can make the manufacture process quickly and efficient.5. How can individuals adapt to the AI era     most of current positions will be replace by the machines or software in the future. But , Some ability of human will not or never be surpassed in the near future. The ability include associative, creative, and logical thinking and emotional.   so we can do something to strenthen  the ability.    first, keep studying and improve our ability.     second, pay more attention  on the creative work than the repeating work.</li>
