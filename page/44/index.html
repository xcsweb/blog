That&apos;s a great book. I haven&apos;t read a paper book for a long time, but the book is interesting and useful so that I finishe it in a week. The book was made up by tens of stories which happend on their daughter,  and express her opinion and method about how to grow a child. There isn&apos;t too much theroy and precept besides the story.  Just like chatting with a neighbor about our children.  It&apos;s comfortable and easy to accept.   And the book is useful for me which have two children.      We don&apos;t have the experience of growing a child and haven&apos;t had any training before been a parent.  So we always study together with our children, the different it&apos;s that we learned to be a parent besides the child learn knowledge and skills.  We all made many mistakes in the period and we are wrong in some sector.  And we always don&apos;t want to  accept the advices of the elder family members.  So, a good book may help us to avoid many mistakes and give our children a happy childhood.       The keypoint of the book is accompany.  We won&apos;t always be better than our children in every areas. And our children prefer to look us as friends or teachers more than leaders.  The status will be helpful for them to learn knowledge and skills, and have more positive attitude  with the world. Provide the good environment and accompany with them and growing together with them.  We also have more knowledge about growing a child to learn.

I no longer have to feel oppressed whenever setting foot into that house, and no longer have to fear at the thought of when I should hear their barbs or imply, or bother to wonder whether it’s my turn to do the washing. The problem lies in who to take over the house duty. Their view is that they are old enough to prolong and go easy with their lives, while I strongly hold that as parents they should support us, especially when the working pressure is getting intense nowadays. I do not mean to escape my duty here. what they need to do is just to prepare the three meals&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;But Mom always tells me not to. To tell the truth, I can’t understand why she insist so strongly. As she says. it’s because we are poor now and need a certain accumulation for the family survival, and that we are planning to have a baby to have an independent atom family. I should have to give up my time and dream of successful career.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;What’s more, it’s said that there is always truth in the elders’ sayings. So, I put up with it and take it.&lt;/div&gt;</p>

The word brings back memories of Weekend<br>morning get up late and spent watching films on television. Last weekend,<br>unfortunately, almost changed the meaning of the word; it was a terrible day.</p>
<p>Every<br>weekend we go to Pan Shan house to take care my plants, trees and my lovely<br>flowers. At the spring of this year we bought a lot fresh flowers to decorate my<br>courtyard. But Tiger gave me a big surprise that he wanted to install a lift in<br>the room at this golden period of the year. Due to this year his waist was not<br>good, he was a little worry he cannot be up to the floor in some day later. And<br>his friend’s home has been done it at their third floor villa, that’s why Tiger<br>has planned to follow him to install an elevator at our home. Even I did not<br>agree he still insist to do so.</p>
<p>Anyway<br>I was hardly to change his mind, just leave it like it I thought. As we<br>expected the term of renovation will be last about one month. I have locked<br>some rooms, and let living room and bed room was opened. After two weeks past,<br>there was only digging a big hole at outside, the inside of the room was<br>nothing happened, we was told that this was for waterproof, it must be waiting<br>till it was dry, ok anyway I agree. And before starting renovation, the leader<br>of worker promised me everything in the room should be covered, but the last<br>weekend when we came to see it, there were many garbage and muck at the entrance<br>of door, in the room some of furniture, curtains and printings on the wall were<br>not covered, everywhere was dusty at the all. </p>
<p>At<br>first I was so angry with Tiger to blame how come like it, let him to talk with<br>the supplier to change the situation as soon as possible, otherwise my beautiful<br>rooms will be destroy, Tiger was a kind man to talk with the organizer nicely, and<br>He was only worry about the time limit of the project, I have to talk with<br>supplier directly and strongly, let them to cover everything they can including<br>carpet before starting it.</p>
<p>We<br>were told that the time of project will have to wait other two weeks, these<br>days I have seen some photos of the lift it looks not bad actually, I was a little<br>at easy. Now I am really hope it will be a big surprise to show us. </p>
</div><hr></div><div class="recent-post-item"><a class="article-title" href="/blog/2019/11/03/A_failed_English_interview/">A failed English interview</a><time class="post-meta__date"><i class="fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></i> 2019-11-03</time><span class="article-meta tags"><span class="article-meta__separator">|</span><i class="fa fa-tag article-meta__icon" aria-hidden="true"></i><a class="article-meta__tags" href="/blog/tags/learn-english/">learn english</a></span><div class="content"><p>This is the second time that I participate an English interview for almost the seem purpose compared with last one, and the result was same too. I failed, twice.      It really disappointed me when getting that message the first time, but this time I was calm and thought carefully just after I finished it. So it is not that disappointing when I finally get the result this afternoon.       The interview was for an summer project to go to Cambridge for professional study and some visits. Only students who pass it can obtain financial support form the school. The others have a choice whether to quit or to pay it theirselves. It is very expensive, about 40000RMB in total which is far more expensive than a team travel lasting the same time. Actually, I haven’t make up my mind to go abroad for futher study and the mainly reason is financal problem, followed by afraid to be complete independent in someplace I never been to before.       After contamplating it carefully in mind, I think the second reason not to go abroad is just the reason why I failed my interview. Yes, it isn’t my not that good oral English , not the well-prepared self introduction I gave, but the afraid and lack of confidence to be indepent on an unfamiliar space.     I prepared my introduction in the order of aim to attend this project, my study grade, hobby and activity, future and experience to do medical research. I made the list accorading to the last interview I attended one year ago. Compared with that one, I performed far more better in this one. I used to prepared nothing but psycological constuction to fight with anxiety, but now ,I can speak what I want to say fruntely in English without apparent interval between sentances. But I still made a lot of grammer mistakes and use simple stentances only.     After finishing my exam, I inquired a teacher of mine who is a interviewer about it. I got the point for the exam. What praise you have got before do not count much, but what you show with your English statement count a lot.      After I got the result a week latter, I inquired a classmate of mine about how he succeeded in it. I got the point for an introduction. How much point you refer to do not count too, but what you get form those experience really count. I focus more on an entire intruction of my life and study, without so much comment on it. I focused only in passing the interview and ignore the research people do it for granted before attending a project like this, such as place of interest in London, information on my profession internationly. I used to focus on overcome the difficulty only rather than to enjoy the period of everyday life.     I’m satisfied with my interview in some way, for I improved a lot which is not enough accroading to the result.      The last problem is about money. My father agree to support me in this case so I’ll go to London this summer. This will be the first time I go to europe and also the first time to leave my hometown alone without my parents or any relative. which could be a big challenge for me. Wish myself a good time.     But, I still feel awful about not getting schools support. I wasn’t an excellent student enough to outstand on a group of peers and even do not earn money though I am an adult. To do a trip like this is, for fun only in fact, nothing about self improvement or a chance to fulfill my study. I feel ashamed to spend my parents money to have a foreign trip myself. As a result, I write this text to recored my thinking and achievement for the initial stage of my “Combridge trip”. That trip will start in July 15th this summer.</p>

There are thousands of teahouses, big, small or middle size,<br>in almost every street. </p>
<p>Among them,<br>one is very special. From the outside, it’s just very ordinary, small tea<br>house, the one you can find almost everywhere. However, every Saturday, people<br>would come here from near and far. Some even come as early as 6. Am, when they<br>arrive, they might have to wait several hours for their turn. </p>
<p>These<br>people, no matter where they come from, they have one thing in common: They all<br>have sort of serious disease, incurable, terrible one, like, you know, cancer. </p>
<p>So now you<br>probably know what’s going on here. yes, these come to a tea house to see a<br>doctor, or TCM, traditional Chinese medicine doctor. Precisely, Mr. Zhao, is<br>not a certificated doctor, he is what they call, a 道医。</p>
<p>Before I<br>went there, I’ve heard a lot of stories about Mr. Zhao. Like he used to only<br>treat the rich and the powerful people, and his service registration was once<br>3000 yuan. But now he only does the free clinic, two days a week. that is, he<br>would prescribe a receipt for you without any fee. Of course, because it’s a<br>tea house, so you got to pay 15 yuan for the tea. </p>
<p>A friend’s<br>friend introduced this tea house to me. Two years ago, she was also diagnosed<br>with breast cancer. Chemotherapy hit her pretty bad. She basically threw up everything.<br>And all the other side effects. Someone introduced Mr. Zhao to her. After that,<br>she almost come to this tea house every Saturday. </p>
<p>I would not<br>believe such story when I was healthy. But now I am a patient, so I guess I am desperate,<br>and I am also curious. </p>
<p>After<br>feeling my pulse, Mr. Zhao pointed out exactly where my tumour is. It’s kind of<br>amazing. He knew that I got breast cancer, but how could he know where it is?<br>Even my friend didn’t know it. It’s like he got X-ray eyes. I started to<br>believe that he was a real thing. </p>
<p>Then he<br>prescribed a receipt for me and ask me to come back next Saturday. However,<br>there’s one drug in this receipt, it’s self-made by him and it costs 3000 yuan.<br>I hesitated when I paid the bill. It just didn’t feel right, especially when my<br>friend urged me to pay it, saying it’s important to boost my immune system. I<br>said that I didn’t get enough money and left. What a lame excuse. </p>
<p>Later, I<br>sent this receipt to my mother-in-law, she was a TCM, and she soon replied and<br>said that I should not take it, because this receipt would add extra burden to<br>my body, which right now I am still and really can’t afford to take any more<br>burdens. </p>
<p>To be<br>honest, I still not sure that Mr. zhao is a miracle-working doctor, or just a<br>liar. It’s hard to tell. I really want to believe that he is a real thing, so I<br>see a legend in person, it’s great right? </p>
<p>I guess there<br>are three possibilities, one, Mr.Zhao really saves life without anything in<br>return.  Second, he is making money from<br>the patient’s despair, suffering and helplessness. Third, he is just creating a<br>I-am-not-doing-it-for-money public image to attract more business. The first<br>one seems to be too good to be true, both the second and the third are really cruel<br>and mean, just in different scale</p>

Expecially I wear short-sleeves cloths. Maybe it can soothe the pressure and calm down the temper. Indeed I am not that kind of people who are easy to get anger. But I am easy to twist the heart when I am facing the problem. Otherwise, I am used to hurry up to solve the problem when I meet the unforseen circumstances. It is not good. It is a weakness of my character. I hope I can be more calmly when I face and deal with the immergency condition. Some little problem actually makes you deal with the things better. It is accumulated your ability to react with the issue what you’re facing. But, I think it can not be bothering us if it is just small and little issue.  I feel good maybe it is because the cool weather. Anyway, I surely will find one day to go for mountain climbing. I just have long time not climbing. Shame! I was too lazy!</p>

The boy and the girl are all from the same area at Shi<br>Lou county of Lv Liang city in Shan Xi山西, where is<br>the most poor mountainous area just next to Shan Xi 陕西. We<br>knew the boy when he was a little boy, due to he is very clever and hard work,<br>Tiger and I likes him so much and we would like him to be our adopted son, that’s<br>why his wedding for sure we would like to give him fully support.</p>
<p>There are four children in his family, the boy is the<br>third one and the last one for the married in his family, we did not think how<br>poor there is, they still live in cave house village which I only saw it in the<br>film that I cannot believe. Due to Shan Xi has many coal mine, that’s why there<br>are many big trucks on the way, the bad air pollution and the traffic are so dangerous<br>for the small car. His parents are all younger than me but they look like 60-70<br>years old, but smiling is so kind and honest I can see, they did not speak so<br>much when we came in to the courtyard, the body language I can read how happy<br>they were. According to the local custom, one day before of wedding, all the<br>villagers, neighbours and relatives have big dinner together gives the presents<br>as returns. At the time the local band with three or four people group were<br>invited as well for the celebration. There was a big red rubber arched door<br>attached name of the bride and the bridegroom. I was told there will be 300<br>more people for the dinner at the night, the chef and kitchen helpers was other<br>group were the most busiest for mess part, the people came for eating all<br>standing there, like running water, one after other, the big pail for food did<br>not like human foods I must say so, but still was gone in a few minutes. Any way<br>I cannot believe and I felt so sad. </p>
<p>The second day morning the wedding was officially started<br>from 11am,Unhealthy custom there were more than 10 black Audi to pick up the bridge;<br>the bridegroom was holding the bridge over his shoulder with the string of firecracker<br>hard to walk, but he had to do like this. Tiger and were honoured to be the<br>chief witness coming to the stage, to showing our loves and wish they will have<br>a great future in the life. One thing was so attractive me till today was the<br>host asked the children and grandsons or granddaughters all went down on their<br>knees for the parents with the harmonious music, this picture was still in my<br>mind cannot take it away. </p>
<p>This was a great wedding party I have never seen<br>before, let me learn a lot and to know there are many rural area like here in<br>China need us to help, to change the traffic situation and let them go out of<br>the mountain area. </p>

Anyway, I should be lived in the moment and also I should try to make myself happy even the environment around us not so friendly. Sometimes, I may involve into bad mood under big pressure or something I can&apos;t handle well. During the past several weeks, I work overtime so frequent that I can&apos;t have a good rest. I plan to gradually lower the overtime frequency when the new production line is running smooth and also I need to take enough training to learn something regarding the new line.I actually don&apos;t know how to create a new program or debug it by myself. Actually, I have the feeling that the new task will quickly befall me no matter I am willing to accept or not. Even I already take the psychological preparation to take this responsibility, I believe before new colleague is on board, I can&apos;t reduce my work loading as long as I work here.    To be honest, I am getting busy this year than last year, but, I am not getting well paid even don&apos;t get yearly pay raise that all of us is expected since the beginning of this year

Produce a<br>force smile sometime the people has to do it when they have heavily in debt. Or<br>sometime in the class, the group of students laugh at the new comer of the<br>picky name. What I am talking about is a sincere smile.</p>
<p>The people smile from the bottom of heart is sincere<br>smile, you can see from their faces and body language, everywhere is simple and<br>happiness to tell. For example, a mother is breathing her baby on her arm, a warm<br>and charming moment of her is the greatest smile in the world. The manager gives<br>the encouragement to the employee after finishing the project; the smile is<br>with the fully trust and reliable. Obama’s speech “Yes, We can” which smile was<br>giving the people more desire and confidence. </p>
<p>Let me sharing a sincere smile of mine. I have married<br>more than 20 years. Simple wedding without any couple picture photos, which I<br>was so a pity till 10 years anniversary of wedding. I decided to the photo studio<br>to make up the wedding photo we missed. On the day we planned, three of us went<br>to there on time, I was following to wear white long dress and some accessories<br>which I loved to take at the long time ago, My dream was realized and coming<br>true, when we took the couple pictures with Tiger, all smiles were appearing<br>happiness, even taken more than hours, I was still in full of energy to<br>cooperate with camera operator, surely it did not have any artificially smiles<br>like other couples does.</p>
