It’s not a common thing for us sit<br>in the same office with foreigners athough there are not any work connection with<br>us. The official language of them is portuguese. One of them have been studied<br>in Wuhan before and his girlfriend is a Chinese, So his oral chinese is<br>excellent for common communication. The leader of them fuently in English. And<br>the others just know a little english. Two of them are European-brazilians,<br>besides one Afrian-brazilian and one Indian-brazilian. The ethnic composition<br>is complex for us.</p>
<p>We are interested with them and want to talk with them, but we are<br>nervous to do that. Tody I talk with them for a while. I give them some tea and<br>they give me two bags of coffee in return. And we talk about how to make tea<br>and coffee. There are some difficults for us to talk in English because my<br>English is not so good. The nervous is a problem too, maybe I’ll do better<br>without that. </p>
<p>Maybe we’ll have further communication in the later days. That’s a<br>good beginning to open my month.</p>

Nevertheless, I still felt depressed for I cherish our reationship a lot. Maybe we just use the sentences of manipulating others sense to validate ourselves independence, fancinating and charming. I can’t take it right.When Dad shouts to Mom on idolence and dirty, followed by Mom grumbles to me over Dad’s male chauvinism and selfish; When someone sit behind scolds on phone about why cannot skip those classes in the day before Tomb sweeping Day’s holiday with a big temper; then night fall, girls hide themself in toliet, having an argument in low voices with tears which actually wake the whole floor’s sleepness. I was watching the ceiling and promissed to my self: I would introduce the book of No Complaint World to she the next morning.I never put that into truth. All I could do is to hear those complaint with sympsthy and remember to make comfort. Besides, think of the ugly purple gracelace on wrists in case I let those hurting phrases out of my mouth without conciousness.</p>

Maybe everyone has their complaints more or less in working, my college complained that he recently suffered a lot from his superiors not only his direct superior, but indirect superior especially when a problem occurred, there is nobody standing up to support him even give him a knife from behind, he was eager to quit the job after shout at these guys who should be standing up for him, but they should not do that at the critical moment. But, he finally gave up the idea to quit the job at the end of this year because of real status not allowed him to do this, because he had a family to support and it was not easy allowing him do this decision hurriedly. So he had to swallow up by himself and could do nothing, what&apos;s more, it will be affected the final bonus to him. All things to him seemed like a tendency of negative so that he felt extremely upset. He just wanted to free his stress and dissatisfaction as outlet. Normally, everyone who involves into working place may face the similar situation in a way, when we have no capability to make changes, the only wise way is to endure it until you can change to fight back or seek a better way to escape that dilemma.

connect to microprocessprs, specificallu,the computers central processing unit the electronic circuiryu that provides the computational abilityu and control of the computer via wires or circuitryu called a bus    Software on the other hand is the set of instructions a computer uses to mainipulate data,such as a word processing program or a videdo game these programs are usually stored and transferred via the computers hardware to and from the cpu software also governs ow the hardware is utilized how imfomation os retrieved from a storage device the interaction between the imput and output hardware is contrlled by the software called the basic io system although microprocessprs are stilll technically considered to be hardware portions of their function are also associated with computer software since mio have both hardwawre and software aspects are  referred  as for,ware    I hardware    I condists of external devices that is components outside of the cp cou that provide information and instuctions to the compiter,a logjt pen is a stulus with a light sensitive tip that is used to draw directlu on a cp video screen or to select information on the screen bu pressing a clip in the light pen or by pressing the light pen against the surface of the screen the pen contains light sensors that identify which portion of the screen it is passed over a mouse is a pointing device desinged to be gripped by one hand it has a detection device on the boottom that enables the user to control the motion of an on screen ponter or cursor by moving the mouse on a flat surface as the device moves across the surface, the cursor moves acrosss the screen to select items or choose commands on the screen the user presses a buttin on the mouse a joystick is a pointing device composed of a lever that moves in multiple directions  to navigate a cursor or other graphical object on a computer screen a keyboard is a tyoewriter like device that allows the user to tyoe in textr

screen cursor an optical scanner uses light sensing equpment to convert images such as a picture or text into electronic signals that can be manipulated by a computer a photograph can be scanned into a compiter and then included in a text document created on that computer,the 2 most common scaner types are the flatbed scanner  which is similar to an office pcopier and the hand held scanner which is passed manually across the image to be processed a microphione is device for converting sound into signals that can then be stored manipulated and played back by the computer a voice recognition module is a device that converts soken words into information that the compter can recognize and precess amodem which stands for modulator demodulator is adevice that connects a computer to a telephine line and allows information to be transmitted to or received from another co,each computer that sends or receives information must be connected to a modem the info sent from one computer is converted by the modem into an audio signal which is then transmitted b telephone lines to the receiving modem,which is then transmiitted by the phone lines to the receiving modem which converts the signal into info that the receiving co can understand    Output Hardware    out consist of external devicess that transfer info from the compiters cpu to the compiter user,a video display,or

I enjoy alone all the way.In few days, it begins with the last quarter of the year 2019. The time does not show it trace, we hardly notice it till we realize we are getting on. Some grey hair, wrinkles and so forth, they make the age and tells the story of life experience. Everyone has his or her stories. They are memories to help rethink and conclude which is the preparation for the next step of life journey.It is doomed to be full of hardship in the process of getting through the life comfort zone. Anyway, it is still recommended to go ahead. If not, there is no room for growth. And we are easy to sink into the marsh. Whatever we go on or retreat, difficulties do not go away, they are still there. Not such a way  for us to choose to avoid troubles. What we can do is to proceed with what we dream and hold on what we have.To be greateful, while in reality, we usually ingore it. It is not a big talk, it does lie in every thing we do. It records the routine of life. There is no turning point to go back, therefor, move on. We are the master of our own. Nobody can dominate you but yourself.</p>

All of a sudden, it comes to the end of this year. When we stay busy in everything, we also face the reality of how time flies. Believe it or not, we are aging. We grow in both mind and body. We become mature and reasonable. We realise what we should do and what else are those things that we are not supposed to be involved in. The cost of life is we sacrifice some time for what we pursue. When we get close to the deadline of 2018, we may exclaim what a year we have gone through.Big promotion can be found among shops and decorations of christmas trees make the atmosphere of Christmas much stronger. The moment I passed by a shoe shop,<br>it had already been shut down. Another fruit shop which started business<br> few months ago seems selling well. I heard of news some foreign festivals are banned by the local authorities. It does surprise me a lot. It is not bad when it comes to the supportive of advocation of traditional festivals, while the open circumstances allow us to come across the boundary and break through the obstacles. </p>

When she was at the school time. Her mother<br>would like her to offering the wine on the dinner party to others, she was so<br>shamed to speak in public, but she had to do this, otherwise her mother was unhappy<br>for her performance. Until she became adult, she still hesitated and be afraid<br>of cheer or speak on the table. Obviously the parents did not lead the right<br>way for the child on the social relationship.</p>
<p>Let me sharing my sentimental experience here. When I<br>was a little girl, I lived in a big family member courtyard since I was born,<br>meaning was the working space, staff canteen, dormitory and school were all in<br>our courtyard together, we had our own theatre, swimming pool, library and clinic.<br>As I know there were about five hundreds families and more than a thousand employees.<br>So this was a really big company, my childhood, the neighbour or my parent’s<br>colleague we all knew each other well. What’s happened for whose family. My mom<br>was a self respect proud, so she always forced me greeting first voluntarily to<br>her colleagues or neighbours when we were meeting each other on the street,<br>which I really did not like it and hard to accept kind of polite ways, that’s<br>why I had never taken the walk with my mom afterward. Till my wedding marriage<br>day, the car picked me to leave our courtyard, I said that I left here finally,<br>the meaning of my life will not be greeting each other again, I really did not want<br>to show my respect artificially.</p>

We’re  a group of middle ages trying to survive the pressures of mid-life crisis. Coming up here today I have no hidden agenda. I’m fighting against depression Fighting against depression is not like fighting a physical disease or a few bad habits in your life. I’m here to speak for all of those being dragged into the abyss of depression. I am here to speak on behalf of that brilliant famous star, who seem to have everything in the world, still threw himself out of that building many years ago, for that man who work 996 for a living and suddenly broke down and ran against traffic with tears all over his face in that rainy midnight; for countless people on the street with worries and tiredness, who hadn’t been really seen by the others for ages. Here you may be IT programmers, lawyers, managers, workers, brick layers, couriers, but really you’re mothers and fathers, wives and husbands, sisters and brothers, and all of you are someone’s  child. You have responsibilities to bear. You don’t even have the option to break down. And even when we have chance to succeed, we are too tired to grasp. We are too scare or dull to truly listen to our inner crying for help. I wish I was brave and strong and resilient enough, and if I were, I would tell you all of my darkest fears, insecurities, and despairs without afraid of being labelled and judged. And now many years have gone by, we have not even come close to understand that we are depressed not because we are mentally weak. Some people always say, “You are what the others see you, not what you truly are”  Well, what you see me makes me cringe at sleepless nights. You always say embrace the diversity, but I challenge you, please make your action reflect your words. Thank you. </p>
