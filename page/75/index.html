Find the leverage, that is quite good but the leverage is always not as precise as benchmark which ups and downs may have dampen the spirit in the course of punching. Keep moving for me is a slogan, intermittently heard with flash stimulus and then dry out within the changeful routine. If the desires may not be acquired then why should we in pain to exchange them, which is a bloody long road with thick thorny and darkness. During the journey, you may lash out and get notice, sorry that is the tiny start. One day you would be languid towards unknown and thinking about every point could trigger you to determine but from where and how? It is forever a compound task, the interconnection is sticky to low your tune or maybe the winning point is once reached deeper understanding of the task or the mastered skills which covered up by the subconscious. Any skill mastered is not by the one time action instead of long time practice kept in the mind and may unpolished during the storing, that is all not easy.    I once revere life and universe, but now seem &quot;subject&quot; this word also as big as a world. Maybe our lifelong persuit just once withered wisdom of someone`s past. Anyway, we are supposed to be value ourselves with own self-evidence.

The year seems to be gone and I can still remember the beginning of this year. How time flies. Since the change and adjustment of the position, I get busier on my work. So I do not write frequently, I am sure that I am here to write something so long as I am avaiable. Dioenglish is part of my life. It provides me the platform to write and exercise. This site has been run for years and I am honored as a member of it.This year, I have read some books. Many of them are finished on weekends and evenings. Even in mornings, I get up earlier than before to read for a while. The more I read, the more urgent I feel since I realise how small and tiny I am in face of the ocean of knowledge. I really have to seize every second available that I can use on books. Reading is another part of my life. I am eager to absorb more from books. History, investment, philosophy, novel, etec. are those fields I read from which is extremely beneficial. It brings me happiness and harvest.Since work and reading have both occupied much of my time, I do not often jog around. Now I sense not that good because the fat on the waist is coming back. Before it dominates my belly, I should start out to eliminate it.In the process of running, it burns fat and consumes extra calories. For health’s sake, I have to do something. Easier said than done. Perseverance is vital and I shall repeatedly remind myself I have to hold on in any case.Simply, I have to srengthen the management of time to do more things in order. 2019 is just right over there.</p>

Since our daughter enters primary school, they have to choose the summer holiday as the best opportunity to go back hometown because of much longer holidays, the direct distance is not too far, if they take high-speed trail as transportation, three hours is enough. But, the tough problem is that they need to transfer a big bus to go home after getting off train. When my daughter was a little girl, I will accompany my wife to go back her hometown at public holiday, now, as my daughter grows up, she can go with her mother returning hometown, what&apos;s more, she is expected to have a happy time with her cousin. On the one hand, she can experience a different lifestyle that differentiates current lifestyles, on the other hand, she can experience the feeling of living in countryside then to enjoy the peace of countryside.    Anyway, hopefully they can enjoy a period of happy and colorful holiday in my wife&apos;s hometown.
