<p>But it’s paradox. Cancer, after all, is not<br>something pleasant. You have to go to the hospital every day, a place always<br>over-crowded and filthy. You get in a long, long line to have your whole body<br>scanned, CTed and MRIed; you sign the papers which remind you of the worst<br>consequence of every check, like death; you are surrounded with cancer patients<br>and you see fear, despair, anger, weak, and suffering in every face. Of course,<br>and there is the pain following you everywhere. It’s easier to handle it when<br>you are misdiagnosed. I mean, what’s the big deal about inflammation? But now, you<br>know it’s helpless cry from your body under the attack of cancer, which is<br>ruthless multiplying and tearing your life apart. </p>
<p>And I’m just talking about the first phrase,<br>which is relatively the easier part. </p>
<p>You see, it’s really hard to feel happy<br>under such circumstance. Still, there are some tips. </p>
<p>First of all, imagination. Every time when I<br>laid down in CT or MRI machine, I imagined myself in a space craft—you have to admit<br>there are some similarities. I imagined next minute, I would be transferred to<br>a faraway galaxy where I was going to fight with some monster. It relieved me from<br>anxiety every time. Or you can just close your eyes, summoning the best moments<br>of your life. </p>
<p>Sometimes, if it’s really hard to be happy,<br>you can transfer all your fears, frustrations, and sufferings into a sort of<br>anger, a deafening inner cry: “I WILL NOT DIE LIKE THIS”. </p>
<p>Trust me, it helps. </p>

As fragile, broken and not a whole as I am now, I still believe<br>miracle will happen. It will come at any moment, perhaps not today, perhaps not<br>next month, but one year from now, who knows? There’re things I can image from<br>right now to make sure I’m prepared when miracle happens and I’m in a good<br>shape again. </p>
<p>Here are<br>three things I want to do: run, travel and hold. Run, means run as fast as I can,<br>with cheerful sweat shinning under the morning sunlight—not this suffocating<br>sweat wrapping up my fragile body right now, no, I want to sweat from running,<br>exciting and vitality. Travel means explore the outside world, to go as far as I<br>can. I want to bring my mum to Tibet, I want to visit to France and Italy, the<br>world is big and there are so many places I want to see. And finally, hold<br>means to hold on to life, hold on to a good, healthy habit, hold on to the ones<br>I love. That is the key. </p>
<p>Stay away<br>from fears and horrible thoughts that could fall over on you. Those mental escapes<br>can help you if you’re trapped at bed or in hospital, but what if you feel so lightheaded<br>that you can’t focus, that even your imaginations can’t break free from the<br>limits of your broke body, where your heart beats so fast that it drowns out<br>almost everything? You want to lie down, close your eyes, and save your strengths<br>for the next round fight. Just remember, it’s a long-time battle. Occasionally being<br>defeated means nothing. </p>
<p>If you are<br>able to get off the bed, take a walk, breathe some fresh air. Get yourself<br>ready and miracle will come. </p>

It was very bizarre,<br>really. </p>
<p>Before I<br>went to the hospital for my fifth chemotherapy, I took ten tablets of DXMS as<br>usually. But when I arrived at the hospital, I started to feel lightheaded. And<br>it was getting worse by the minutes.</p>
<p>Soon I fell<br>into the state of dissociation, in which the whole world seemed to be dreamlike<br>and unreal.  </p>
<p>The<br>following day was cut into many tiny pieces, and I only got some of the<br>fragments, but most of them had blended and lost in the foggy memories of my<br>mind. </p>
<p>I kind<br>of remembered that I could not walk the straight line when I came down to take<br>my targeted drugs. I almost lost balance and bumped into the staff from<br>Sinopham. </p>
<p>And<br>then there was so many people getting in line for the next elevator. Just the<br>thought of joining them and cramming myself into a tiny, over-crowded place<br>made me even more light headed, so I decided to climb the stairs. </p>
<p>I<br>couldn’t make it. I slipped on the way and fell down from the stairs. I remembered<br>a doctor rushed to me and helped me up. But I couldn’t remember clearly about her<br>face. She might ask for help, because there were a few more doctors coming<br>after that. </p>
<p>What<br>happened next was a blur, disconnected and unreal. When I looked back, I had to<br>think really hard to rescue some wrecks of my memories from this sinking ship. </p>
<p>How<br>they called my husband, when my parents came to the hospital, how did they take<br>me to get a brain scan—I had no memory of these things. </p>
<p>My<br>husband even had to sign a high-risk notification! </p>
<p>I slept<br>on and off but even I woke up, I was still in a dreamlike situation. But even<br>under such situation, I somehow managed to finish my reading notes—what kind of<br>obsessive person I am!</p>
<p>The<br>only possible explanation for this bizarre situation is that I probably took<br>ten sleeping tablets instead of DXMS—I was in a kind of hurry, and these two<br>look very similar. </p>
<p>I was<br>lucky that I didn’t get myself seriously injured. My cancer has already transferred<br>to my bones, so my bones break easily. Somehow when I fell down from the floor,<br>I just got some blues. That’s almost a miracle. </p>

I hate myself! I hate myself without putting enough effort to pursue what I want! I hate myself being easily giving up. I hate myself lose the passion for doing things. I hate myself without a clear aim and stick to it.  I don’t have friends to talk and share the things.  That maybe one of the reasons why I can not relief from the pressue. It is panaroid!  Is it destiny for living a lonely life. Without loved one to care and nobody to care about self. It is such darknest life, is it worthwhile to live a life like this. What a shameful to myself. Like a deserted man.  Do I have capability to fight back? Do I weapon up myself so that I can defend the attack from the society. Time is cruel and fair for everyone. I can not blame the fate, society and others too. What I can blame is myself. Do I really have a try? Have a try to make the better life? I can not answer this question! I am not ready for answering it . I hope that this is not an excuse. I do not understand myself sometimes as what I said before.  Life is mysterious. Like a puzzle and wait to disclose.  Take a sigh and have a rest. Hopefully, do not lose the courage to continue the life journey for everyone  </p>

I felt extremely exhausted, unfortunately, the terrible trend will be started from next Monday to Friday day again. I should have a good rest to deal with the following things. What&apos;s more, the customer will come to our plant with complaints. Some issues we need to discuss with customer which needs to provide the reasonable explanation. Currently, we have no idea regarding some issues, I don&apos;t know what will happen whether the customer will yell at us. Basically, it will not happen, but, we should do the worst preparation in advance. The customer just gave us the praise last week, but, today we received the complaint from customer quickly even we don&apos;t adapt ourselves accordingly. Anyway, the next week will be a tough week, basically, the big challenge is not how we handle these issues that customer took, is the how to balance the internal sources to solve these issues to make sure they don&apos;t occur during the next built. As most of guys knew in office, the relationship is complicated in our department even can&apos;t work on one case that&apos;s a really painful thing. Sometimes, as subordinate I really don&apos;t like working such atmosphere. But, the actual situation is like this, we have no power making it change, but to accept it. Once I have to coordinate resource internally. I will feel powerless, because it is really a difficult job.

<p>l  Set<br>achievable aims</p>
<p>l  Plan<br>ahead</p>
<p>l  Out<br>of control</p>
<p>l  Unrealistic<br>expectations</p>
<p>l  Lack<br>of foresight</p>
<p>l  Stay<br>on track</p>
<p>Step 1 – Create a sense of urgency</p>
<p>It’s not enough<br>for change to simply be a good idea – people need to understand why they need<br>to act now. Make the objectives real and relevant with an honest and convincing<br>dialogue about what’s happening in the marketplace and why the change is<br>necessary.</p>
<p>Step 2 – Build the guiding team</p>
<p>Bring<br>together a group of people with the right mix of skills from across the company<br>to plan ahead and be the driving force behind this change. Select people who<br>want to work on this change rather than those who have to, Have them brainstorm<br>all possible complications – a lack of foresight at this stage is one of the<br>key reasons some changes fail to stick.</p>
<p>Step 3 – Create a vision</p>
<p>Have this<br>team establish a clear idea of the desired outcome to give people a sense of<br>where they’re heading. When people can see the vision for themselves, then they<br>can focus on the initiatives that are needed to achieve it. Be careful to avoid<br>setting unrealistic expectations however – you don’t want to set the team up<br>for disappointments later.</p>
<p>Step 4 – Engage people</p>
<p>Involve as<br>many staff as possible by giving them opportunities to act and ensuring these<br>actions are supported and encouraged, The more people who feel empowered by<br>doing what they want to do rather than what they have to do, the more likely<br>the change will occur.</p>
<p>Step 5 – Remove obstacles</p>
<p>Consider any<br>possible barriers to achieving the vision, These could be existing hierarchies,<br>processes or even people who refuse to participate, Eliminating these barriers<br>builds the necessary freedom and empowerment that allows people to move forward<br>with making the change.</p>
<p>Step 6 – Create short term wins</p>
<p>Set<br>achievable aims that can quickly deliver positive results for your team. Then<br>celebrate when those aims are met. Nothing motivates more than success and<br>celebrating these achievements prevents negative thinkers from hurting the<br>progress of the change.</p>
<p>Step 7 – Sustain the change</p>
<p>Real change<br>takes time so continue to celebrate achievements as you meet future goals, If<br>you run into problems, deal with them as soon as possible. Don’t risk undoing<br>your progress just because the change is now official, as even at this stage a<br>negative situation can quickly get out of control.</p>
<p>Step 8 – Formalize the change</p>
<p>Reinforce the<br>successful change by making it policy, This ensures that the values and<br>initiatives are seen day-to-day in the company and that existing and future<br>company leaders continue to support the vision and help the change stay on<br>track.</p>
