<p>歌词：</p>
<p>Have<br>you ever heard that a girl had been to the stream that you are crossing?</p>
<p>走过那条小河，你可曾听说，</p>
<p>有一位女孩，她曾经来过；Have you known that a girl<br>had left a song to the reed slope that you are passing by?走过那片芦苇坡，你可曾听说，</p>
<p>有一位女孩，她留下一首歌。Why are the clouds weeping<br>quietly?</p>
<p>为何片片白云悄悄落泪?Why are the gentle breezes<br>whispering?</p>
<p>为何阵阵风儿轻声诉说?And why are a flock of red-crowned<br>cranes flying over lightly?</p>
<p>还有一群丹顶鹤，轻轻地轻轻地飞过。Just because the girl<br>never shows up again.</p>
<p>有一位女孩，她再也没来过Only the clouds shed tears<br>for her;只有片片白云为她落泪，only<br>breezes whisper about her;只有阵阵风儿为她诉说，in<br>addition there is a flock of red-crowned<br>cranes flying over softly. 还有一群丹顶鹤，</p>
<p>轻轻地轻轻地飞过。</p>

No matter how I made efforts, I couldn’t defecate as<br>before. Then I decided to use the glycerini enema left by late wife. But it didn’t<br>work either. Finally I solved the problem with the aid of external force. I couldn’t<br>help admitting that I have been aging both on features and organs. The gastrointestinal<br>peristaltic function has greatly weakened. My chewing also turns fragile. I must<br>take measures to avoid the occurrence of constipation by eating more vegetables<br>and taking more excerise.</p>

<p>操吴戈兮披犀甲，車錯轂兮短兵接。The flags blocked the sunlight and the enemy<br>troops were just like masses of clouds. Although showers of arrows came down to<br>each of the warring sides, the fighters strove to charge at the enemy. </p>

Nowadays more and more young and middle‐aged villagers rush to the<br>large cities seeking employment and wealth and leaving their old and young<br>behind at their rural homes. Some of these migrating workers are so successful<br>that they have become permanent city‐dwellers with their own apartments and cars. The longer they live<br>there, the clearer they see what a high price they pay for the settlement. Because<br>their old can’t tear themselves away from their villages, elders of empty nests<br>have grown. They lack necessary care. The new town dwellers find themselves second‐class citizens and their kids<br>rejected by one school after another except for paying more tuition fees than<br>the old inhabitants.</p>

Our ancient Confucianism,<br>medicine and architecture are still playing important roles in the modern life.<br>Adhering to the instructions of Confucianism, we can behave properly for<br>establishing harmonious families and a civilized society. However, a lot of our<br>nationals have turned followers of Buddhism and Christianity from abroad. Moreover,<br>huge sums of money have been spent building many magnificent Buddhist temples<br>across the country. Such way of acting at present seems to be a reversal of<br>host and guest. As for our ancient medicine and architecture, they are the<br>treasures passed down from our ancestors and we must carry out our duties of<br>cultural inheritance because they are unique in the world.      </p>

The biggest drop is about 10 degrees centigrade in some areas. Some places in Xinjiang and Heilongjiang will even expect snow. The hard time of the year is to come. At first we’ll feel somewhat uncomfortable with the change but soon we shall adapt to the severe weather. In fact winter benefits our health because we can sleep longer and work less than in other seasons. Compared with the southerners, the northerners have good health and a long life. The cold weather is really advantageous.   </p>

He is not ashamed of his low status and never complains about it. He has no desire to distinguish himself. He prefers to do all things according to his conscience rather than please anyone only. Mr Hale was such a gentleman. He gave up the position of a clergyman, which had ever brought him a comfortable income, because he had grave doubts about the faith he had followed. He couldn’t reaffirm his former faith in Christianity as the bishop demanded. He would have felt guilty to preach the sermons to the congregation. </p>
