He will respect your ideas and opinons, even when he doesn’t agree. He will pay attention to details about your likes and dislikes, and he will accommodate your needs to the best of his ability.If he respects you, he will compromise on little things, like shopping with you he doesn’t care for because he knows you like it, or bigger issues, compromise is an important sign that he really loves you. True compromise doesn’t mean “I will do this for you, if you do this for me”. It is not a negotiation.  If the man really loves you, he will treat you with respect. He won’t degrade you or put down your achievements. A man rellay loves you will pay attention to what you like and dislike. He will try to make sure you are happy, because your happiness really matters to him.</p>

<p>On September 1st, the day before<br>school started, a 13-year-old boy jumped from 8th floor and killed<br>himself after being scolded by his parents for spending too many time with his<br>cellphone. This news, along with a video of the grief-stricken parents crying<br>over the body, flooded our wechat moment and the parent’s groups. From the<br>screen, the paralyzing despair of the mother and the heartbreaking howl of the<br>father seemed to materialize and suck out of the air. </p>
<p>Many left comments, trying to find out the<br>reason. As if by doing so, we could finalize this terrible accident. So we were<br>eager to blame, blame the boy for being too weak, blame the cellphone for being<br>so addictive, blame the parents for being too harsh, and blame the school or<br>the society for ignoring the kids’ mental health. We blame this and we blame<br>that, because it is an easier thing to do. For example, it would be easy for me<br>to say: “How could he give up his life so easily when someone is trying so hard<br>to live?” </p>
<p>I didn’t say that because I remembered<br>those moments in my life, when I also saw this world through a distorted<br>reality or precisely, a distorted cognition. I remembered those moments where I<br>felt as if all the colors had drained out of the life and when I stared into<br>the future, there was nothing but an endless dark tunnel full of uncertainties<br>and fears. I was there, so I knew how easily we could snap at a certain moment.</p>
<p>I guess for everyone, there are moments in<br>life you would feel vulnerable and helplessly, there are moments you are simple<br>too tensed up to breath. </p>
<p>And when you were there, the last thing you<br>need in the world was the pointing figures, or even the well-meant suggestions.<br>All you need was probably just a moment of peace, non-judgment, no criticism.<br>Just to know that somebody was there, listening with an understanding ear. That’s<br>probably all it takes to save you from that horrified, distorted world.  </p>

What<br>kind of picture of cover can tell my meaningful for this year? The title of<br>book has to match with other sister books, for example the first letter of all<br>is “S” started, and also can tell and express what happened in this book, this<br>and that, I am starting to dick out some ideas from my deep heart.</p>
<p>Base on previous books, white, green, purple, yellow<br>and blue. The colour of this book I determined that Red to be the main colour. Red<br>is more high lighting and attractive, it is more splendid like our red flag. Therefore<br>I was surfing the internet to find the pictures are more fantasy, dreamlike<br>under the red background, the file of the picture has the specific demanding,<br>PSD file only can draw the text on the photo, so that’s why it is not easy to<br>find the right one.</p>
<p>I remembered some friends gave me book their messages<br>for the wishes on the first page before and I did the foreword for the book as<br>well, but this book I don’t know yet whether it will be added or not, looking<br>forward this book of 2018 will be born in the next month.</p>

Currently, the big problem is how to set up the electricity and<br>compressed air accordingly, it seems like suffering a severe problem and if it<br>can’t be solved by Thursday this week, that means the next step of all things<br>will be delayed even it is possible to put it off until the end of this new year.<br>If it is so, it will be the worst result that we are not to see it, the next<br>step the facility department will mobilize all possible resources to push the<br>process keeping on going as early as they can. It will be a challenge job to<br>them, from our side, we also hope all things can turn back to track quickly,<br>after all, we are expecting that it will not affect the following New Year<br>holidays. Because, we will spend lots of energy and time on the second<br>production line in evaluation and verification after it was installed. That means<br>we will have a tough time to focus on this new line for all kinds of issues<br>solved and debug on site during the next two months. As the current situation<br>develops, the work overtime will be inevitable in the following time and will<br>keep a long time. The most problem we faced with that we are always short<br>hands, meanwhile, the management level doesn’t like adding new hands anymore. Because<br>the sales will not increase next year based on current forecast, I guess that a<br>new wave of departure will be coming after the New Year holidays, anyway, let’s<br>go and see……</p>

It&apos;s no choice, because I currently need this job and can&apos;t lose it. Recently, I deeply found as the growth of age, I need consider a lot before I make any decision. I no longer make a decision just by myself. It&apos;s just as the old saying, if you can&apos;t change the world and change yourself. Absolutely, I don&apos;t think I am a powerful man or excellent man, most of something, I can&apos;t refuse because I lack enough power just like today, even I already completely spoiled by my boss&apos;s instruction, but I have to follow up no matter how reluctant I am. Meanwhile, I must adjust myself in good mood presenting in front of him. Maybe, today I met just a piece of cake to some guys, but, for me it will cost some time to digest, sometimes, I also told myself that I can&apos;t too attached for one thing, if I don&apos;t want to live very hard.

I<br>am the English lover. I really envy somebody who can speak good English and so<br>confident to show themselves in the public when they are speaking. </p>
<p>Yesterday was Mother’s day and weekend as well, I<br>believe most of the mothers and her families had been gone out for the celebration.<br>I was invited by Tiger to attend this speech because he knew I will like it, even<br>there is a little rainy outside, we were going to there by bike that would be<br>much romance than any other families in the restaurant.</p>
<p>The class room was not so big, there were only 10<br>participants and three judges. We were always the early bird, after confirm we were<br>only for listening and still welcome to the class by the trainer. The class<br>will be started at 2.30am while we had the chat with one of judge who was Asian<br>people. All participants would have competition order by lucky draw like<br>playing game. The first one was a girl with short skirt and jacket. She was a<br>little nervous to introduce herself and after five minutes, She had gone into<br>her role to read the poem with lovely back ground music, even she played it by<br>her cell phone, I cannot read her clearly what she main meaning but from her<br>emotional, I can see she has good pronunciation and intonation. The second one<br>was a boy who was sitting in front of stage to read an English story with<br>music, so attractive me was he was never shy to act what he did, maybe this is<br>the generation after 90s. One of judge was a foreign face who was the manager<br>of this training centre. His comments to each students were honest and in<br>detail, some words are encouragement but some words to tell what should be<br>improved during the speech, like eye contact to audiences and smiling of the<br>speakers are most important factors, you know some of students were shy to speak,<br>so their voice was not louder enough and hardly to control the speed of<br>speaking.</p>
<p>One girl was so impressive to me, she was so confident<br>on the stage, she did not read, all tell the story from her mind, she has prepared<br>the show for four days that would be much better than reading the text. One<br>short boy who was the couch, his work in the fitness was only for his tuition<br>fee, he was from He Bei province that’s why he was apologist to everyone for being<br>late be his starting. </p>
<p>If I were the one to be participant, I believe I can<br>do it and maybe I can do it well. This is a really good class I like the<br>atmosphere there, I learned a lot. Everybody is modest, kindly and friendly to<br>others no matter you are the member or not, Here are the international family, I<br>believe everyone here are English lover, why they are here together.</p>

Many of us just feel it is unfair that somebody can be rich and successful. Surely, something we can not change, while some other things we can find ways to take them. Hard, but it still shows that we can try. Never underestimate your power and you are potential to be a qualified warrior.The world is a magic stage. We never know its edge and limitation. It is more than we can image. Let it be, sometimes we just feel comfortable to move forward. We learn and absorb, meanwhile digest and accumulate. Never reply on some so called experience which can lead you to success in a short time. It is never going to happen. Life is not easy, live at present and cherish what we have. There is no such a road we can fully go through without bothering. Actually, it is full of risks and uncertainties. Why do we have to be hard on ourselves? Because sometimes we have no choices. When the burden lands on shoulders, we have to embrace and envisage it.</p>
