But my little brother angry with my behavior and feed back the words to me: Do I need you teaching me how to live?  What do you think if I want to change you in some aspect with my mind?      Yes, he was right. I don&apos;t want other people to change me.       We born in a democratic family.  We choose the way ourselves and stand all the racket by ourselves. So, we seldom regret for any decisions because we&apos;ll choose the same way followed our mind if there is another chance.  We choosed our university, major, work location, our career and wife by ourselves.  We are happy for that because that is our life.        I think the greatest advantage of the current world is that whe can live individuals withe the support of modern city function institutions,  Such as banks, shopping malls, hospital, shools, old people&apos;s homes and so on.  We don&apos;t have to live in a certain group and keep a relationship such as family, village, or a company  in order to support our life. So  we can get the most freedom in the current world although there are still some compromise.  We can pursue our life without caring other peoples words.  We don&apos;t have to be great , famous or be a sucessful man in other people&apos;s view.  What we need to do is find our real happiness.       That&apos;s the life of ourselves. Don&apos;t want to change others and want do that for me, Even between the family members.         Let us select our way.  You can&apos;t do that for me.

So nobody wants to have any complaint from<br>relatives, as the time passes, the people are following the rule including me.</p>
<p>Yesterday was after this special day and I was not busy,<br>I wanted to make up my hair in dark brown colour as usual to cover some white<br>ones. So I went to a barber near my home. You know I have my long hair for many<br>years, I am so confident for my hair due to it is heavy and strong then others,<br>that’s why I am looking more younger, hehe, I said to myself always. I went to<br>the barber only a few times a year, I did not know which shop is good or not.</p>
<p>I entered the barber after my breakfast, I was so<br>happy to see there are only two customs and two service boys, I thought I did<br>not wait for long time for sure. Can you come here this afternoon if you don’t<br>mind? one boy said. Even his voice was so polite but I was refused by them I<br>felt, I was shocked and answered him immediately, ok got it, I would go to<br>other shop next to you, my response was also respect and determined. You know this<br>shop I will not come again in the future, because I felt I am not so welcomed<br>by them, they will be lost one of potential clients. If the boy let me have the<br>seat first I can understand even I hate to waste my time, in fact, only the boy<br>said one word just casually, but the oblivious transfer to my mind, I believed<br>his boss who was starting up the business was so sad to lose the business at<br>the pressure of the investor. </p>

After simple renovation he moved into the cottage that is inside the yard and lived a happy and leisurely life.It gave me a leap in my heart after reading the article. Is this the life that I want?  Stay away from the noise of the city and go into nature, and have the life of “Picking chrysanthemums under the bamboo fence, Looking to the Southern Mountain leisurely.”A company in my hometown guesses the thinking like mine. They launched a project to satisfy people who want the life in the countryside. Costing 100 thousand yuan to buy a plot of land and cost 50 thousand yuan to build a cottage on the plot. Then moving in the cottage, you will realize your idea soon - planting on the plot and eating the grains and vegetables yourself. We can lay on the bed, look up to the moon through the window and count the numbers of stars in the sky. It is a very romantic scene, isn’t it?  In fact, this is merely a dream. It may seem impossible to come true. Because my family won’t agree with me to carry out the absurd plan at all. I am a retired man now and my healthy situation is not very well. I will encounter all kinds of difficulties in my existence if I live in the countryside. I probably have no ability to plant the plot myself and harvest grains from the field, like an old farmer. I can’t adapt to the living environment that has no telephone, TV set, and Network. How can I go to hospital to see the doctor if I am ill?  If my daughter comes back to see me, would she live with me in the countryside? So the dream is only a dream, but the life is truth. Life wouldn’t let the absurd plan to be a reality.It is not necessarily to satisfy these conditions on geographical environment to fit retired people’s requirements such as peaceful and quiet life. We also have access to get these life conditions in the city. So we mentioned that the peace and quiet is more of more of the old people’s own mentality. If you keep the calm in your heart, you will have a leisurely life, even if you live in the center of city. Corrected by Teacher Chawee</p>

As you know every year<br>of the day, we prefer to buy one gift which is very useful and more valuable,<br>on the one hand to helping her life easier, on the other hand to make her<br>happy. </p>
<p>She sent me message by wechat, she wants to change one<br>bigger washing machine, she sent me the link of item, wow, and washing machine<br>cost is at least 5 to 6 thousands, I know her machine is pretty new and nothing<br>wrong, how about the old one? No enough space for two machines at her<br>apartment, I have one child in my family, since each of her birthdays we tried<br>to satisfied her need, but this was really to my surprised, I had been kindly<br>refused her request, I asked her politely, could you change other one instead,<br>due to the current machine can be still used. My daughter was so understand and<br>said, May I ask for a Dyson hair dryer? I thought the dryer could be no<br>problem, ok I said immediately.</p>
<p>I see Dyson is a very famous brand of England. Recently<br>years Dyson products have been into Chinese families gradually, I have a Dyson<br>cleaner wireless which is very popular right now, which is breaking the old one<br>with long wire and big noise. After I checked the price of dryer, the cost is<br>about three thousands each, surprised me, One dryer is cost a lot, but how can<br>I refused her again at the birthday, I called her warmly, let me asked you one<br>question before I bought for one, how often you can use it? You have no long<br>hair, every morning you curry up for work, I believe you don’t have much time<br>for your hair on each day, so it is not good one, I did not mention the price<br>is a little beyond my budget.  </p>
<p>She kept silent and said nothing, I knew she was very disappointed,<br>but she has to know my point is reasonable. The birthday was coming, I told the<br>thing to Tiger, He was totally agree my suggest. He transferred money to her<br>account in cash instead of the gift, Money is only a number, tell nothing, I<br>know she must be complain my action.</p>
<p>At the last week, I went to a barber for my hair, the<br>hairdresser was using a Dyson dryer for me. It is so elegant with some<br>different function of heads. He told me I was the first guest using new Dyson<br>dryer, this was my first time to see it, I thought that’s why my daughter like<br>it so much.</p>
<p>I promised I will buy it for her at next birthday to<br>cover my regret.</p>

What’s your feeling?</p>
<p>I was busy with Tiger recently, and I have no much<br>time study EF English for two weeks. As usual I must be one hour a day at least<br>on line learning EF. I knew my EF account is about expire in this month, but I cannot<br>remember which day is exactly, I was happy to my efforts from 7 to 11 level in<br>a year, so far only one unit left to level 12, I want to catch it quickly in<br>the limitation time before complete the course. I was a little worry I hope I<br>will able to make up all I missed by being absent. </p>
<p>This morning I was full of enthusiasms to wearing my head<br>set earring phone and closing my door for study only, I was afraid by anything<br>to disturbing me, But I did not know why I cannot log in my account? There was<br>a test window let me key in process number, how come? I have never such<br>information during this year, I contacted my teacher in wechat immediately, I<br>know if I contact him by phone, even I could get feedback right away, but maybe<br>it was not so polite. He gave me a hotline number, meaning was he put my<br>question to others, I thought it was not so difficult problem, I felt no so<br>good at first, but anyway I followed him to check, the answer was I have to get<br>the process number from my teacher, not from others. I called him again angrily.<br>On my understanding was all teachers from EF are very kind and keeping smiling<br>face always, although I was an on line student I go to the training centre not<br>quite often, but I have joined some classes and I have seen some teachers<br>before, they are willing to help others. But in fact it was not.</p>
<p>He was impatient to tell me the completion of the test<br>is only for face to face class, it is not including on line students. But I got<br>the answer from hotline was not, the test should be including all the students<br>no matter you are on line or in face, even he promised me to double check again<br>for me. I was so disappointed that I was abandoned by my great EF in my heart, I<br>was with you for a year, I love you so much, that’s why I avoided any negative issues<br>at all the cost to with you, at last, making me so lost. Nobody remind me<br>before expire of the account, maybe if anyone to tell me I could renew my<br>account. </p>
<p>Anyway, the time to say bye to EF, I will continently<br>study my English forever, but not in EF this platform for sure.</p>

Half of the summer vacation is over. I was troubled by my two children’s illness the other day. Fortunately, with the  care of us，the two babies have recovered . I am  really relieved now. Today is a rainy day . My husband went to work early in the morning.  We had soybean milk and deep-fried dough sticks for breakfast. I spent a wonderful time with my two children today. We sang, danced and played games together in the morning and slept for two hours at noon. For dinner ,we had eggplant stuffed dumplings . They are delicious! My daughter and my husband ate a lot of dumplings, they enjoyed them , completely. At this moment, I feel very happy. I have two happy and healthy babies, one is six years old and the other is three. For us, they are angels. My husband is not a very handsome man . He is tall and strong, who is two years younger than me, but he is a responsible man. Since we are married, he has been protecting me and our two babies. We  are devoted to each other and seldom quarrel. We have a happy family. Time is short and unfortunately we are all getting older.  There may never be a better time than now to live a meaningful life with our parents and kids. From now on, I’d like to catch each opportunity to accompany my parents and  my babies. I will share my experience,achievements, joys and moments of pride  with them. I hope we can enjoy ourselves every day in our whole lifetime. </p>

I think it&apos;s a good idea that we now have to pay for plastic bags in some stores. And instead of driving to school or work, we can ride our bike or walk. If it&apos;s far, we could take the bus. In this way can we lead a low-carbon life. All these small things can add up and become big things that would improve the environment. Let&apos;s take action now.
