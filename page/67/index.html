He is my Tiger my sweet heart.</p>
<p>Since the year 2008 coincident meeting, he left the<br>state – own enterprise GM position determinedly; He made the decision with his<br>brother to open their own property company. At the beginning there were only 20<br>more employees till now it has developed more than one thousand staffs on board<br>officially. They have gone through all kinds of hardship and difficulties, the<br>bottleneck period made bring them more strongly and rich experience. On the<br>contrary, they are cheering what they had and it must be taken for start a<br>business.</p>
<p>At the end of this year, everything of the company is smoothly<br>and growing up. Tiger had a very peaceful decision, He wanted to resign the<br>chairman of board position, remain more chances for youth and others, maybe his<br>health is not good enough, he wants to relax and retire early, go out with me<br>for travelling, and in fact we did lot outings in the past few years. His office<br>with full of antique furniture was left to others, He likes a small white collar<br>staff moving his computer to home quietly.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the day of Winter festival, as Chinese tradition,<br>every families has the dumpling at the home, on the dinner table, we had the<br>chat happily and freely, talking about the resignation, Tiger said to us<br>deeply, Have you heard a poem “再别康桥”. This poem is so match with my mood<br>to the company.</p>
<p>Very quietly I take my leave</p>
<p>As quietly as I came here</p>
<p>Quietly I wave good-bye</p>

Now it starts out the theme of winter. I prepare well for this since I have enough clothes and water. In order to keep warm and healthy, it is strongly recommended that we really have to take care ourselves.After days of rainning, it turns to be sunny today. I haven’t seen cleary the sunshine for weeks. What a long time. After baptism from the sunshine, the twillight came soon. The day is so short which will last to the Winter Solstice.The side effect of winter is it is extremedously hard for most of us to get up on time in the morning on weekdays. I see many guys catching buses or rushing to subway stations. I was in that situation too at the first beginning. The warm quilt is always like a magnetic and invisible hand which powerfully holds you back to get up. Luckily I am back to be normal after several days’ adjustment, as always, I get up without hesitation. </p>

I emptyed my shopping cart and get many great goods in a lower price. I took 1500 yuans for the goods and saved more than 400 yuans than usual.    I know the 11.11 shopping day for many years and want to buy something on the day, but I quit or just buy few things in the end. Because there are many problems let me quit: It&apos;s a waste of time to grap a red envelope with just 0.1 to 1 yuan inside;  It&apos;s so complex to find the discount coupons and find the way how to use it; Prices of some good rising before and giving us a discount on the shopping day , and we get some goods in the same price as usual in the end;  We have to buy some unnecessary goods to meet the discount requirement. All of that made me headach and let me quit in the end.    But all of that became more and more easy and real this year, besides I have many things to buy. I began to select the good which we need a half month ago and buy them in the shopping day. There are more discount and rebate than I respect and I placed the order and paid for that as soon as possible.  That save me some money, and more important is that most of the goods are necessary for me. Take a electric pressure cooker for example, the price is 499 to 799 in malls besides  the price is 399 in a electric business plat in the normal time. But I got the cooker at the price of 280 RMB in the shopping day. That&apos;s make me happy.    The 11.11 shopping day has became a shopping festival in just ten years. The business volume reached 230 billions yuans in the Nov.11 of Taobao platform, and more than tens time of American black friday.  There are many others platforms such as Jingdong, Sunning, Vipshop and so on also take part in the festival.   The shopping day showing the strong purchasing power and the electric business  of China.     Waitting for the next shopping days at Dec.12nd, the lunar New Year, May 1st,  Jun.18th, National day and so on.

<p>When I enter the high school, I have a poor<br>performance in my study. My parents feel nerves ,but I can’t improve it.<br>Gradually I began to hate study. I slept in the class, copy class mate’s<br>homework. Unfortunately I failed my chemistry. After this exam, he had a talk<br>with me. I told him, I don’t know how to study, and maybe study is a bad choice<br>for me. He said “No, no, no you just need to think more ,think more, ……you will<br>be the best student of me” . The talk touched me a lot. After that I have more<br>patience in thinking, though maybe low efficient. He also told the way to solve<br>chemical problem. </p>
<p>The same time, I became interested in<br>social problems. Sometimes, I will be upset because I can’t change the world<br>and solve these problems. I attempt to talk with somebody. But no one can I<br>talk. Finally, I told my confusion to him. He tell my a lot. He tell I should<br>think more.</p>
<p>Just these two words, these change me a lot.<br>It help me learning, and tell me how to think the social problems. I won’t<br>forget it, I won’t forget my chemistry teacher.     </p>

In<br>contrast, those who hold the second view think that if one is not prepared, he<br>can hardly have any opportunities: however, if one is prepared, he can have a<br>lot of opportunities.<br>  As to me, I agree with the latter. Admittedly, there is really an<br>intense competition for limited opportunities, but it is not to say the one<br>can’t create opportunities himself. In most cases opportunities are created by<br>people themselves. For example, many people lost their jobs in recent years.<br>Some people wait for opportunities in vain. However, others create<br>opportunities themselves and get self-employed. Eventually they become employers<br>themselves.<br>  Therefore, to some extent, one can take his destiny into his own<br>hands.</p>

And at the end of the programme there will be a English speech contest. The winner will get a big award.  And the promotion in our company also have it&apos;s TOEIC score requirement. So the programme is a good thing for us.      But most people seemed not interested in that at all. There are few appliants before the deadline.  So each function department was forced to recommend two team members to participate the contest.  I am one of the two poor members in my department. I don&apos;t want to do that but I can&apos;t deny my boss&apos;s order. I don&apos;t confident with my english although my TOEIC is more higher than others in my department.

The contest hold the day before yesterday. I had prefpared the speech PPTand communicated it with my partner  from the last week . The contest include three part: self speech; debat between partners; judgers questions. All the contest will last for 15 minutes for each peole. I write all the content which I may talk in the contest.  And exercise it in my dormitory for two times in order to do more fluent and control the time. I am getting anxious days before the contest.       The time arrival in the end.  We are the fifth group to give the speech. All the program is as smooth as we expect although the speech not so fluent.  There are not big problems , and the important is that I can uderstand the questions of the judgers and give the answers  correctly which I worried before.  The most important for us is the contest finished smoothly. We don&apos;t have to worry about that any more. And we are not the worst although we are not the best,  and we are better than many of the appliants. That make me happy and confident with my english skills.  The contest result will come out next week, but it doesn&apos;t important any more.       I begin to hope my perfect english skills in the future. Maybe that is not only.        Go ahead . I can do that.
