A roommate named “Ruan” said the real texter is noisy in midnight. So I am sorry for the mistake in my passage.I am really angry in evening. Another roommate names “chen” droped water on my items in the small balcony. It is not the first time, usually when I found that, she is sleeping or out, except tonight. I told her and got the first rude and unminded answer:        “I know that.” In an of course sense.I decided to solve this problem forever, so I changed her hook with mine–in a better site,with nothing under it. I told her after done with that, to get the second rude and unminded answer :        “how dare you touch my hook without telling me?” she is the typical modern colledge student, spoiled, bad in doing housework, seldom manage her belongings. We have lived together for three years, and I told her I changed her hook to a more convenient place after that. Usually when I saw cloth dripping above my box in the corner with no one admit , I use the unnknown basin throne on my box to collect water, so did this time. Chen rushed to her position-changed hook and saw that baskin, got angry. She gave the third rude and unminded answer:         “”does your clothes never drop water?” I just wonder whose cotton underwear and socks will drop water after washing like thick coats or jeans. I always carefully hang this kind of cloth in the middle with nothing under after shrinking water to the largest degree. I keep telling myself I am an intellectrol and modest young lady and never scold others with rude and unminded words. So i just write a little complaint here. I have saw a book named the world with no complaint, hoping I can contribute to the beautiful but unrealistic dream in near future.</p>

The doctor just reckoned not, the result is you got sick and the following priority thing is to cure it. Get sick is universal thing in your life, going to doctor is essential, the small alienment one time to hospital is enough to fix it up and of course you have to endure the several times lining up with chaotic background without mentioning the blood sacrifice you know. The worsened thing is your feeling is quite not good and hard to describe the symptom or the vague sympton not clearly enough to the doctor as you may guess the ensuing remedy is not right, what you have to do is waiting the illness corruption to clarify rightly the sympton, god bless you, it is a time comsuming road which afflicts your mind, body and spirits we may experienced one way or another. Ok, let back to my cough. Whether the remedy is right or not totally depends on after the medicine the improvement you have or not in short time, it has nothing to do with the time period accumulating. These days temperature up bolster my healing progress as a ferment, thanks for the god, maybe it is called the nature power in a way we may neglect long time ago.</p>
