But it is catastrophic<br>for the environmental protection. The deafening explosions of fireworks greatly<br>pollute the clean atmosphere of the neighborhood and violently disturb the<br>quiet community. Moreover, setting off fireworks is dangerous and can easily<br>cause a fatal fire. The sanitation workers have to do more cleaning while some<br>people compete for the winner who has a longer and louder display of fireworks.</p>

They bustled back and forth loyally and vigilantly and never<br>returned until seeing their young owners enter the school.</p>
<p> After Morning<br>Reading, the school staff and the student body would go jogging on the country<br>road. Headmaster S said taking exercise outside was because there was no<br>playground at the school. In spite of the backwardness of the hardware<br>conditions, he added, the educational concept must keep pace with the times；keeping fit and safe both<br>physically and mentally would be of the first importance forever.</p>

<p>因接受不了网上的人对她的评价，因此还被气的住院了。Xu Guihua, commonly known as Sister Straw Hat,<br>had been an ordinary farmer before success. </p>
<p>徐桂花，我们俗称“草帽姐”，在没成名之前是位普通的农民，However, in her finest hour she began to speak<br>indiscreetly.</p>
<p>不过随着走红她就开始了口无遮拦，Once in a program she said a great change had<br>taken place in her life after she became known; 草帽姐在一次节目中说过，出名以后自己的生活变化非常大，it was easy to make money for her now and tens<br>of thousands of yuan could be earned provided she opened her mouth.赚钱不但变得很容易，而且一张嘴就有好几万。</p>
<p> This aroused the abhorrence of a large audience.</p>
<p>让很多观众开始产生厌恶!</p>

So she decided to sleep there guarding against dangers in spite of my opposition and persuasion. I worried for her because both the room and the kang within were cool and she might catch cold. She has been getting used to warmth of the east room heated every day by the cooking stove. The effort to heat the west kang failed yesterday evening with a lot of smoke left in the room.   </p>

He conveyed discreetly principals’ new decision to me. I had been assigned to a new post, the sanitation worker of the schoolyard. He said I might accept or reject the assignment.
