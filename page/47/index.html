Of course, the disappointed news that the pay rise will be cancelled temporary which should be scheduled in Feb. as to whether have the opportunity of salary increase will depend on sales in the first half of this year, that means the best result is to gain a pay rise in the second half of this year. According to current latest forecast, the sales of first quarter will shrink by 25% compared with the same period last year, what&apos;s more, there is no sign of improvement in current market conditions. I don&apos;t know whether other industries existed in similar situation, at least in automotive electronics industry, this depression will continue for some time. No doubt the strict measure of compressing expenditure will be followed up if the situation continues to second quarter, a series of activities such as yearly travel, yearly family day and monthly dinner party will be stopped. I can&apos;t imagine how result will happen if the sluggish in industry lasts until the end of this year. From the positive aspect, current situation will improve in the following months even we actually don&apos;t know what will happen in automotive industry.    Hopefully, everything can go back on track, the tough time can go through quickly, after all, we all will become the victim when suffering the business depression.

I’m touched. English learning is just my little hobby. It has become an<br>inseparable part of my life. It is English writing that pulls me out of my warm<br>bed every day–considering the weather here right now, take my word for it, it really<br>says something. </p>
<p>I need this little mind game to kick me<br>into fully function, which means I’m writing on a daily basis. However, most of<br>my writings are just bits and pieces stuff, hardly presentable. And since I’ve<br>been almost occupied all the time, I haven’t troubled myself to keep my<br>writings, until now. </p>
<p>It’s the end of year. I’d better spare<br>sometime to sort them out and put them there. Formality, no matter what, is necessary<br>in our life. (Here I’m really trying to say: 生活需要仪式感.<br>So if you had better idea, please let me know.) </p>
<p>Just as I said before, imitation writing is<br>a good start if you don’t know what to write about. Here is the one for today：</p>
<p>We need to think about our wishes<br>differently. Sometimes it may not lead to happiness, it leads to our downfall<br>instead. Human beings have the freedom to wish for anything they think they<br>want. When we are sober and clear-minded, we will wish for the things that make<br>us better and make us happy. But when we aren’t—because we’re traumatized,<br>misled or lost in this hustle and bustle world, we will wish for something that<br>might harm us. The path out of unhealthy wishes is to form healthy wishes, to<br>be connected to your inner voice, to understand what you truly wanted. Despair<br>is just one symptom of the cries after wrong placed wishes granted– that’s<br>happening all around us. For too long, we’ve talked only about granting a wish.<br>But we need now to talk about making a wish right. The opposite of wish is not<br>despair; the opposite of wish is to be misled.  </p>

No need me to driving come and back at the rush<br>hour in the morning, Everything is the same as before, once in a week swimming<br>at Wednesday, other days is running on the machine, due to the opening hour is<br>late a half hour than before, so I would like running out door first till 7am<br>the door opened, I continuity do the running on the machine.</p>
<p>I knew an old couple who comes to the club every<br>morning like me, they only like swimming, why they come here so early, because<br>of their son have to the work before 8am, and then they have to take care their<br>grandson at home, the morning is the golden time for them at all. I must say<br>who loves sports, no any reasons for absent.</p>
<p>I get to the gym to see them every Wednesday at the<br>swimming pool, and to know they live next to our community, you know the people<br>like sports who are always keeping smiling face and like to talk with others<br>warmly, they are simple and kindly. More and more the people prefer doing exercises<br>in the morning. This pool is the small one with 25 meters long and 20 meter<br>wide only, so one swimming lane at least three people in, I prefer swimming in<br>the middle lane, just with the old man in one lane, by occasionally, we against<br>each other underwater, I immediately said sorry for him and his reaction was<br>the same to me, this was very normal to across each other I said, at the<br>meantime, Tiger came in to the pool when I was talking with a man, he said to<br>me coldly, do you need the umbrella, the outside was raining, I know he doesn’t<br>like me talking with the strange guy, and his good friend was just divorced due<br>to his wife goes with other guy with the same interests, this was so sad experience<br>and good lesson to them, don’t give your wife any chances to go out without permission.<br>He just wanted to tell everybody there, this is my woman</p>
<p>I knew he was jealous of my action, I showed my face angrily<br>after back home, you were so sensitive, you may believe me completely, I just<br>friendly talking with others, nothing special, I said. He loves me and he was<br>afraid to lose me I know, but sometime if so sensitive it may make me hardly to<br>breath, right? </p>

The story of “Stealing<br>fire” is originated from ancient Greek mythology concerning Prometheus. He stole<br>the fire from Olympus and brought it back to earth. But I understood that the<br>main point of this book is to introduce the conception of mental flow and present<br>how it functions magically in American military special operators. The author likened<br>mental flow to another fire stolen from Olympus.</p>
<p>Even though I<br>haven’t read this book myself, I try to explain mental flow by my own<br>understanding from TV show. I remembered that the biological teacher told us the<br>most of the human brain to everyone has not been developed. The human brain is composed<br>by thousands billion cells, and their functions are still mysterious for us. However,<br>we realized our human consciousness is mostly produced by our brain, as complex<br>as the structure of the brain, and it is usually difficult to be stopped and<br>controlled. The so-called mental flow is a mental status, in which the brain<br>only focuses on what someone is working on with no other distraction, and in<br>which the one could also enjoy or be immersed in a satisfying feeling and the<br>time is neglected. In simple words, we turn off all the others of our brain<br>except one part to focus on what is going on, that is the status of mental<br>flow. The status can optimize the organization of the special operators and<br>shorten efficiently their learning time. To master a new foreign language could<br>nearly take six weeks for them.</p>
<p>Based on my<br>experiences, mediation is a practical manner to access to the status. The status<br>could help me to have an efficient rest for ten minutes and to drive away<br>negative emotions shortly. </p>

Some guys have already gone back home and some are on the way home. Fewer and fewer passenagers are found on the subway and bus, the city is getting quiet agian.When I look back, time does change me something when I am getting on. That is something like the trace left on the road and I can hardly wipe out since it happened and the memory left in mind.We are not a kid anymore. That means we have to be accountable and reasonable. Sometimes we may recall what a wonderful age we had in the childhood. It never comes back. Now we are facing many things, meanwhile we realise life is not that easy, we still have to move on. Time never tells us of the value of life. We have to discover it by observation. Probably, an unexpected experience can just be another start of life journey.There are must be something we have done and some other else we do not perfectly fulfill well. Accept what we have and do what we like. The short life does not allow us to waste too much time. I hope everything will be fine in the year of pig.</p>

To make my stressful is that if I failed to take this responsibility from my colleague, I could be fired at the end of this year that it is not what I expected. The reality is that I do not have so much energy to focus on this new process for me. Nowadays, I have millions of tasks on my hand that already makes me exhausted in a way, if adding more woke loading to me, I am not sure whether I can handle it under the control. I am wondering if it is the necessary stage to everybody who wants to get to the higher level in career. It is a big challenge to me that I suspect how long I could stick to under current working atmosphere. I also told myself I should insist on keeping this situation as long as possible until I totally get hold of knowledge in coating process. On the one hand, it is for skills improved for myself. On the other hand, I may get promotion if I can fully take this responsibility from positive view.    Sometimes, I have to comfort myself that continues to learn more, then you could have the opportunity of getting more in life.

Everyone who involves in this project has common sense that the project is very important to our company. As to why the project transferred to my hand,because it occurred a very serious problem that already caused complaint from customer so that the boss took flanking tactics of changing other people instead. That&apos;s why I confused that it is an opportunity or a trap for me, if I can take care of this case, I may win applause, but, if I can&apos;t take care of this case, I will be bearing a bad reputation of poor ability. What&apos;s more, my main concern is if I am ready to take this responsibility especially if I can have enough ability of English skill to face foreign customer&apos;s question face to face. I know I lack experience on this respect.    Now, I am nervous and excited to meet a big challenge with great difficulty. I hope I can go through this rough period with colleagues&apos; support.

As always, before the end of lunar year 2018, there are still many things to deal with on work. Meanwhile many guys are busy booking tickets for going back home in Spring Festival. Even though I have set up the alarm clock on my cellphone, it is sort of hard for getting up in the morning when the phone rings at 6 am., since the warm bed which looks like a giant magnet firmly drags me back. Unconditionally, like ohters, I fancy for the warmth of bed. I have to take this challenge if I do not get up in time I will be late. After countdown by three, two, one, I get up.This rainy winter really makes people easier into depression. Only few sunny days came out, most of the time, it rains and had already snowed twice. It is tremendously uneasy under the high humidity weather for a very long time.There is no idea to predict when it is going to be sunny. Whatever, we have to wait and go through this winter.
