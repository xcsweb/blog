When I was back, my clothes was totally soaked. After having bath, it is cool now.No one can predict when it will be sunny again. Everyone fully took a stroll in the noon after having lunch. The gentle sunshine cast on my face, the pulse of spring came into my heart. Quite enjoyable in face of warm breeze. Some blossoming flowers silently inform the arrival of this vital season.No matter how it rains, it is just the season which brings us hope and infinite longing. </p>

I can fully sense the coolness in both morning and evening. Next week, it is reported another typhoon is to form and possibly come. The beginning of autumn emerges into the stage and sooner or later, it is getting to be more like that season. Next month it will be much more cooler. Then it can be comfortable to come out.</p>

Though the path approaches to the goal is not that smooth, everything for that is deserved. In the process of being good is full of difficulties which are the obstacles always prevent us from moving further. Actually, if we move another step forward, we may see the chance right there. The destiny is not made by one action, it is based on the perseverance of every step. Rome is not built in a day. With that strong hope, we can not be easily beaten down.The bitter of failures do pain us, but we can not cave in since everything still goes around, even without a single person, the world remains its orders. If we go ahead, we observe what we meet and feel what we experience. Then we gradually know the misery of life and will be more accountable. The cost of growth is we sacrifice something we love and learn how to judge and choose. We understand better of what we have done. We never act like a kid, on the contrary, we turn to be endurable. In that way, we realize the truth of life struggling relies on both the toleration and the persistence.We are the masters of our own. At the time when we are on top of the mountain we overlook everything behind we have conquered.</p>

The greater success you’ve gained during the holiday, either as exciting as travelling, or as sedentary as staying at home, the less comfortable it seems to be when you go back to work.  But this is part of life. It takes me some efforts to get up at 6:00, and brace up for another normal day, with working, learning, family chores and everything a normal life requires of.  I hate to think how challenge it might be for my husband, who after a whole year of the most painful long holiday, to get back to the society.  Itï¿½s the first day for him to start a new jobï¿½in a new company at a new field.  Of course it’s  great to have this opportunity, a life saver indeed. But it wonï¿½t be easy.  There are a lot of adjustments and difficulties to overcome. Physically, he still can’t drive, and he still can’t sit very long. Mentally, he needs to learn a lot, to catch up with the society, to embrace challenges, pains, fears and even failures.  But itï¿½s the battle he has to fight, because it’s not just for money, but more importantly, it’s the battle to find his old self back, the man who is assured of a place in this society.  It’s also the way to get back to normal. No matter how we fight against the mundane, the normality, once loosing it, we would realize how grateful we should be just for being normal.  It’s also the treatment to get recovery. A doctor oneï¿½s suggested:” Find a job, go back to work” A degenerated bone has degenerated. But it’s not one bone to support your body. Unfortunately, once you spend the whole day doing nothing but think about that degenerated bone, you amplify the pains and the other bones would start to stop working. Some diversions, only a job can offer. It’s better to fail trying than keep quitting. So fight. </p>

Everyone has overcoat to welcome this winter. Walking on the streets, the chilly wind sharply blows against me. The lobby of company does brighten and strengthen the atmosphere due to the Christmas decoration. It is warm particularly at the time entering into the room and seeing those cute gadgets, such as small houses, Santa and trees, all looks so sweet by the colorful lighting. This does help build the harmony.Everything is fine except for the snow. Compared to the northern areas, here it seldom snows in winter. But it does make you uncomfortable living in this season because of its cold which lets you tremble at anywhere you stay. There is no heat and you hardly succeed drying clothes especially in wet weather. The weather forecast says it is likely to snow tomorrow. According to the lunar calendar, tomorrow is the Great Snow. What a coincidence. Whether it is true or not, it does sign the coming of a real winter.Anyway we still survive from all seasons.</p>

Trying to use our product as a customer and create<br>user’s dataset help me understand what values the product deliver to users and what<br>the main pain point is when using our product.</p>
<p>After<br>having users’ mindset, it’s time to get an understanding of what is going on<br>and learn the architecture of our product. I need to know the whole software<br>process and what our team’s main task during the SDLC. </p>
<p>Getting<br>a complete insight into my team is also a high-priority task, including<br>reviewing any automated test scripts, reading product documents and<br>specifications. Then I can define to what extent our test engineers can add<br>value for the entire process. </p>
<p>It<br>is crucial to setting up quality metrics for the product and SDLC, such as measure<br>bugs number per 1000 code lines and rate of the bug-fixed, shipping delay rate,<br>etc. After getting the current quality data, we can get down to list the tasks<br>we should do and set priorities for them.</p>
<p>To<br>summarize, understanding what is critical for our system under test is important,<br>do not dive into details too early.</p>

<p>What’s best method<br>for such an interview you hope to pass? The first thing to do is finding<br>several similar interview videos or records I can follow. My interview is for<br>the Quality Assurance Lead position and what I just did was reading the vivid<br>interviews from How google tests software.<br>From this book, I learned the normal questions for interviewing a quality<br>tester(QE) and quality engineering manager, I recorded some interesting<br>expressions from interviewees’ answers and tried to use them in introducing my<br>own experiences, That helps me a lot.</p>
<p>When I got the<br>interview questions and answers, the next thing I did was answering these questions from my own skills, ideas and experiences. For doing this, I didn’t just showed<br>my experience and knowledge. What’s the most important thing in such an<br>interview? Show your passion! I took my own examples on explaining why I had passion<br>on software testing and what my mission was in this area. It is the basis of<br>following discussion on some concrete skills or methods. Now I am preparing for<br>these answers.</p>
<p>After preparing my<br>questions, maybe an essential step I will face is oral expression, I will have<br>to do some practice and record my answers, which definitely helps me speak in<br>English continuously and fluently, at a good pace.</p>
<p>For doing such<br>preparations, I think it will improve my interview performance rapidly. To be<br>ware, focusing on a concrete subject, such as software testing, is the key to success,<br>since if your prepare for general English conversations without definite<br>subject, you will feel exhausted before you made obvious progress no matter if<br>or not time allowed.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will<br>share my answer for one or two questions related to software testing. Bye!</p>

<p>So the first it can say it was the long time period,<br>and then six of us, amount of people for the group, you know as our ages, we<br>have the parents, and children, the most of husbands are the babies need to be<br>take care all the time, it is very hard time to have our own time even one day absent,<br>the phone calls are never stopped to ask where his belt or tie is. The third<br>one was the special for this trip that we all have shameless to live LiLi’s<br>home freely. Including three meals a day, having the bath, washing the cloth and<br>living for such long time, If I were LiLi, definitely I cannot accept it, even<br>my blood brothers or sisters, I would rather let them to live the hotel nearby,<br>but LiLi knew most of our friends are not good living standard, she can<br>understand if let them pay the room charges for two weeks, it was a big amount<br>of consume, Friend is we need and friend is indeed. She is the one.</p>
<p>If we did not go to, I believe this winter will be nice<br>and romance days for her and her husband privacy time. </p>
<p>So this trip we got together was the golden time to<br>relax ourselves, that’s why our group nick name is “take leave without delay”.<br>LiLi is the leader of ours, she is more smarter playing digital like phone or<br>ipad, so the booking the ticket including parks or cars are all easy for our outing<br>arrangement. We have visited the local traditional Li nationality culture, and<br>Monkey island, talking the group photos is very important task in our mind, as<br>we plan we were all wearing the red color skirt at the blue sky and sea to be<br>twinkle star, I know it was too low but we still like it and very proud of<br>ourselves in front of public. Some young people don’t like to see as our ages<br>to be crazy, anyway, just do what we like. </p>
