But the reality is we are just the startup,no matter how hard and how stumbling blocks you get through. The vacaboloary you remember morning that faints in the evening and vague more not sure the right spelling the next morning while confused digging down in your mind. It would be conducive repeating the fruition day after day but how feeble or devastated you know holding a host of masses which overloaded almost collapses your hands. That is why we alway just keep updated of some part and forget the large section as a result in the relief that we keep moving. You may justify the surroudings are not favourable for your position, yes, that is true. The foreign around you please believe are not native tongue, most are Europen so it makes to reason you two both more or less the same level of english speaking. Maybe in first place you think they are good, but with the time and conversant of the situation, it is easy to conjecture up what they are muttering and god blessed you nothing less than that they are intellectual enough to make their oral very sophisticated in which insinuates or incites your door suddenly opening up in some way. Another mountain you have to climb up is the grammar, never look down on it, it contains a lot in which are adequate to refresh your way of thinking, so another puzzle in existence in which showing the pitfall or loophold we expose ourself very clearly and barely.All mentioned above may shake your confidence, determination and emerge the question why we should on the move. For me, instead of answering the query, i perfer to find the formula, in the making and finishing up. We are supposed to be with inernia, tardiness, foible in common, it does not matter. Keep moving is one thing, aware of tortuous path, thoroughfare in some degrees frustrates you, it is ok. Make it be your lifestyle.What i have to cheer myself up is currently bearing more than this problem, one problem you may ornate saying killing yourself, with many i have say full of schedule equates full of life.</p>

When the results blatantly contrast the trusted formulations, we just cursorily appease ourself with more patience next time or another nice philosophical cover that judging sth by heart not only the sense. So it that enough?     We learn everything by making senses from the interactions in a way you think right during the whole operation and gradually elicit from the surroundings to further on and on until the result comes out. Yes, that is the basic grounding. What if you somehow lose the direct interactions, you are forced to be less confident while decision making, as this makes sense it is easier in business negotiation by face to face expression instead of on a phone call.

Believe it or not. Myself find out the same. But i am an introvert person so that I was lack of the social communication skill with social activity. So shame of myself! Thinking that I am a sales guy.  The world is big, but the individual activity space is usually limited! I do not have big dream about travelling the world. I just hope to become something useful. Nothing is easy in this world. If we want something, we have to fight for it. This is really the living and surviving philosophy.  Maybe heart is getting hard and stiff. we found we are not easy to get moved too. When I found beggar in the street, I felt nothing for most of time.  Each of us we have this or that kind of pressure, nobody is really happy. Maybe few of people who get happy, but I know it is not easy to be happy as there is really tough in the reality life. Childhood time maybe be happy, really? I had a lot of housework without done which usaully put me into the worrying situation. Exam is another threaten that I was worring for most of time during my school days. How can get rid of those worrysome, fear, weakness? You have to get a strong heart. How to get a strong heart, I personally think excersise is inevital to having a strong heart. I have to make my physical strong first then my mind too. My legs are a little bit ach as i went for mountain climbing day before yesterday.  otherwise, I quited few days without drinking tea as I got a terrible cold cough. I hope things are all getting fine</p>

My dad are one of them, indubitably, my drinking passion is no less than my dad, to be precise that all relatives never rejecting this invitation for once as it like a thoroughfare of beverage.    I do not need to emphasize the pearl milk tea quality problems in material-picking processes or operation marking processes, since the brand milk tea stalls are willing to follow all the sanitary standards and they are legal. We love them with greatest passion can be proved by the branch numbers in every city. And what makes this beverage so red-hot for such long time. Yes, sugar. Sugar is addictive, not only your tongue loves it, what is more, your physical body and mental spirit all love it. It offers energy, sweetness and happiness during the whole digestion circulation. Maybe the fat received by your belly, needless to say, the irresistible evidence. Pearl milk tea with no sugar, it is right on menu. Is that true, we all know the fact.    So for the health good, i juvenile using coffee to supplant pearl milk tea. It works a little with foreknowledge the same addictive, this time, coffine. Instead of the coffee from coffee shop, i choose to instant coffee. I totally agree the taste not quite good, the only merit of all is the drink amount i can firmly control to taper on behalf of one day i can get rid of being addicted. What embrassed me is when i got a coffee form shop yesterday, it tasted much more delicious that it once was. I have to say my tougue seems not like my idea, next time it has to cherish every drip of good coffee. One day, when i am not controlled, i will undo the body with balanced consumption.

It is said that gentleman should change the bracelet from left to right if he complains about whatever unpleasant little  annoyances during the day, and move it to left again when he makes complaints the second time. He asked me to do so as well though I just let it fade from my mind. The period last about half an year. Long before, the purple ugly bracelet was lost in the house like all of those small interesting pieces we bought in the passed long long life such as magic cube, Korean crystal hairpin and many books. I saw the bracelet several times after that in cleaning activities but it would soon disappeared in my mind in all time.Then I grow up to the age enough to care about interpersonal skills and psychology. Sometimes the theory of no complaint in world occured to my heart unexpectedly so I try to follow it. On one hand, it’s good for making friends with strangers who you never known before. On the other hand, it gives way to avoid being disgusting in others’ eyes. On yet the other hand, no complaint in everyday life can shape ones personality in …….just the good way, but what’s good is unclear. An roommate of mine complaint on my personality and the way of speaking yesterday on dinner table, face to face. Actually I do realize that I’m different from nowadays majority which is not a illusion. However there is no right and wrong on different types about personality.To be continue…</p>
