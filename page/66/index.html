<p>Why she is important in my life, because we have known<br>each other since teenage school time, we were in the same training school and<br>working in the same department for ten years, we can share any secrets each<br>other, I remembered we were lying one bed in her grandma’s home to see adult<br>magazines under the dark room, we were so afraid to find by others, We are<br>jealous each other dating with boy friend before marriage, I was so proud to<br>have my boyfriend early than her, I was the one to company with her to say bye with<br>her first love. I can say I know more her than her husband.</p>
<p>The people said both of us were very similar from appearance,<br>Both have big eyes, the almost same height, that’s why we were confused in the<br>public, calling me Anita, and she was called Rosanna, only the personality is<br>different, she is more soft than me, and I am a little bit tough and direct, That’s<br>making us match together. I have a daughter is one year old than his son, my daughter<br>went to boarding school was only I was following her action, to educate the<br>children were more independent instead of spoiled at home. Only because of Chinese<br>traditional thinking that the wife cannot be old than husband, otherwise we might<br>be the relative by marriage.</p>
<p>I left the first company and encourage her follow my<br>action, after 10 years later, She made the big decision to follow my footprint<br>to join the same group. I can say she was working hard and only one or two years<br>later, she was accepted by her boss and promoted promptly. By the chance she<br>left the group and she became the big person and very important position in<br>this current company. I believe she will have the great future, no matter how<br>big potato she is, she is mine, right?</p>

Even now, I can hear the sound of rain. This time with high humidity and stuffiness, precautions of mildewing preventing is a must. It is also the time for the harvest of wax berry. I had some shared from a colleague today. That is enough for me to have a taste. Because of the rain, I have canceled some nights of jogging. Last month I had finished 100 km in total. This month I assume it will be no more than 60 km. As long as I run, I freely relax myself on the way. And I keep a better figure and have successfully lost some weight. The rain is unpredictable. It rains all of a sudden and stops without any signs. The best way is to bring the umbrella at any time in case it unexpectedly rains.</p>

The Spring Festival is the most important Chinese traditional festival, being worth celebrating with entire family. To Chinese people, family gathering, family meal and visiting friends and relatives etc. are essential during this festival, which is not expected for us either. After six years of working in SH, I have my own family of three, so in order to take care of both families the vacations should be shared with. On New Year’s Eve, we took the annual reunion dinner with my parents. Then we went to the hometown of my wife on the first day of the festival. The relatives of my wife were very hospitable and we almost every day had the delicious meals of local flavor prepared by them. No need to get up early and no pressure from job, eating and sleeping are the theme of these days, which makes us live like a happy pig.In night of the third day, there was a heavy snowfall here, which might be not encountered every year. I was very lucky to view the snow scene of Riverside Park, which is said to be one of the most famous views of the city (please see attached photos).   But we cannot help say “the happy time is always short” in the end of the vacations. I was wondering what the happy time for us is. The happy time was enjoying delicious meal, irregular living schedule or no external pressure from job, financial situation and interpersonal politics etc. I think the last one can explain why most of us have no way of really enjoying our own lives. But in the jungle of mankind, what can make you live easily? Some people say it is money, or getting rich overnight; some people say it needs to practice one’s own spirit by turning to religion; some people say it should attempt self-change…   </p>

Every one in the office was delivered with a small box of mooncakes and a medium sized box packed with some pomegrantes. I do not know what is the exact reason for giving us pomegranates. But it is the right time to have that fruit in this season. Well, that is for the festival. This festival is a symbol for reuinion, especially for family members being together. Particularly, in the ancient time, according to the customs, sitting around with family members, and it would be great with the admiration of the moon while eating mooncakes. Nowadays, such a occasion is not that easy to have. Mostly, we just realise the festival which is called Mid-Autumn Day is going to be coming. Or rather, it is only a festival, something like Spring Festival. We have the holiday. That is all. Yes, for many of us, we have to work for living. Much of the time is fully occupied by the work and trivials things from life.Whatever, we still have mooncakes. Usually the ingredients of mooncakes are sweet that some guys, including me, do not like that taste too much. Sometimes you even can not feel your teeth after having that kind of a mooncake. Anyway the atmosphere of the festival is warm and harmonious, though it is not that strong compared with the old days. In order to avoid that kind of sweet taste, there are many new kinds of mooncakes made to cater for people. For example, some are with fruit ingredients, some with yolks, etc. They are more acceptable. But we still have to know they are still the food with high-calorie.At the same time, the scent of osmanthus flowers adds to the joufulness. I am totally intoxicated among the light smell. It is everywhere in the city. Even in a remote path, you can never easily miss that scent. This is the gift of the nature which brings us the palatable moment.</p>

More tree leaves turn into red and yellow. More like autumn, I love this season. When books are finished, I sense myself reborn again. Meanwhile, I realise how time flies and how important the time it is which gives us the meaning of being in this world. It is like the fruit grows to be mature waiting for us to reap.The fine weather brings good sunshine. It comes in the morning and ends in the evening, has the beautiful scenery present to us. When twilight dominates the evening, golden lights become the fire shinning from the skyline. Wonderful. As I walked through the park, square dance was already on the show. Not just old ladies, aunts, but also some women at their mid age all joined in the dance. You never know where they are from. Probably they are neighbours from some living communities nearby. They are people come together to dance, in the park, alongside the bank of a river or in the open air in front of a supermarket. They are everywhere. The point is they have a ball.In the night, I am more available in the realm of my mind. I spend the time thinking of something, such as the plan of going somewhere, ways to find some nice books to read. Silence of night does not make me sleepy, I am to understand more than before about meditation. An inspiration all of a sudden runs into me, striking my nerve. I am powered again. I seize it and do it. You never know when will it come again.</p>

They also care about your occupation including how much you earn per month. They seem to be gossipers. They are also glad to keep questioning. This very scene happens in holidays, such as spring festival.For all intends and purposes, you feel sick of being in that situation. Out of courtesy, you have no choice but to cater to them by answering carefully and prudently. You pray such kind of a conversation could end as quickly as possible. If you are impatient to put up with that talk, on the opposite, it is quite likely to be finished up by responding them with resentment from your eyes.Unless you are permitted, you should never be involved in personal privacy. Otherwise your rude and impolite actions really let others think you are the person who are not supposed to be with. We are not in the old days. What we need to learn is to be understanding. Freedom is on the base of mutual respect, no one wants to be forced to do something that he or she is not willing to do. The pathetic thing is most guys do not realize it and even take it for granted.</p>
