Choose interest classes is a necessary work for most parents who have children between 4~12 year&apos;s old. My son have been attended in the classes of drawing, hand-writting, guitar, english, go in the past 3 years. And we may try some classes such as dancing, taekwondo, swimming and so on.  Is that necessary?  And what goal will we get?  Are the children like it.      First, I think it&apos;s necessary for a children to learn more aspect of the world beauty and to have more friends. May be they can find their hobby or the career direction in them later lives.  For me, I didn&apos;t find I love drawing until I saw a drawing of my classmate in university.  So the classes may helpful for them to learn more besides school classes.       Second, I don&apos;t think my children will be a musician or an artist in the future.  So, I won&apos;t push them practice too hard. Happiness is more important.  And the artist education can help them enjoying the beauty of the world, and have a happier life.       Third, to teach them how to insist on something.  We will select 2~3 classes which they really like and keep practicing them for a long time. Maybe that will be their hobby.  We all know that to be a professor need longtime practicing and hard work,  we can&apos;t be professional in many areas.  Too much class isn&apos;t a good thing for children,  that may lead our children not processional in each areas and it will affect his later life.       We always choose the classes follow the interest of my son.  And he is happy in the classed till now. I hope he can have a happy future.

Why? I think lack of stable test method<br>is the answer. For example, imagine when we test a system like skype, how can<br>we develop a test suite for it? Most of engineers write test cases according to<br>the requirement document, but how to make our test cases cover more branches<br>and find test cases which are not covered on the requirement document.  One feasible method is assessing the case<br>space for one occasion under test. First we list all the factors involved in a<br>test occasion, which let us know one case is comprised of how many different factors.<br>For instance, skype client A, network channel, skype client B are involved in<br>one test case. Then we try to list all the variables for one factor, for client<br>A, these variables include different devices, different version of operating<br>system, different input text, etc. the network channel includes 2g,3g,4g,5g,wifi,<br>intranet, broken connection, etc. After listing all the variables, we can<br>assess how many test cases are enough to cover this occasion by multiplying the<br>number of these variables, for example 10 for A, 10 for network channel, 10 for<br>B(the same number as A), the result is 1000 test cases. It’s amazing, right? If<br>we manually list these test cases, it seems an impossible task. Comparing to manual test cases, not all of test<br>cases generated automatically is valuable, we can reduce the number of test<br>cases by combining some status, such as 3g/4g and deleting some ridiculous<br>ones. After some priorities, we can get a subset in a reasonable account, this<br>subset covers the most important test cases we should test. </p>
<p>In sum, when coping with complex test occasion, do<br>not start with listing cases, instead, try to assess how many test cases we<br>need cover the test occasion. </p>

In order to keep<br>fit, it is suggested that you take the following advice.To start with, regular exercise makes you<br>physically strong enough to deal with the stress you might have to endure in<br>the quickening pace of modern life. Besides, keeping a balanced diet by trying<br>a wide variety of health foods and avoiding the junk food, because health foods<br>can provide us enough nutrition for our body and contain no chemicals or much<br>sugar or fat. The last but not the least, prevent your emotions from making you<br>sick. Keep this in mind that the foundations of good health lie in love,<br>laughter and faith in oneself.Though many other factors contribute to good<br>health, these suggestions are worth trying and will definitely do well to your<br>health.Start walking, jogging or cycling. No matter what your<br>speed is, walking, jogging and cycling are very important parts of a healthy<br>lifestyle as they are activities that keep your heart and lungs active and your<br>blood flowing. If you need to keep your knees strong or have body aches and pains,<br>then cycling may be a better solution.Exercise at home. Not everyone has the time or money to go<br>to the gym and there is no need to. Working out at home is very easy and can be<br>very beneficial.Exercise in the gym. If you like the gym atmosphere and can<br>afford the membership then the gym is a great place to stay fit.Join a local sport team. If you are not a fan of the gym or<br>practicing random exercises then joining a local sports team may be a great<br>solution to get outside, move around and have some fun! Many cities have their<br>own recreational sports teams that meet and play on certain days.</p>
<p>Staying fit is a great way to improve your mood and overall<br>health. Many people struggle with staying fit over time, but the benefits of<br>fitness definitely outweigh the costs. With some commitment and motivation, you<br>can maintain your physical fitness for years to come!</p>

<p>The first thing I<br>want to mention is that I can decide what skills or experiences are shown to my<br>interview. I have worked in software testing area for more than ten years, I roughly<br>know what my interviewer knows and what he expects me to tell him, so I can<br>prepare some materials for these potential questions. But is it enough to leave<br>a good impression on him? Definitely not!</p>
<p>Apart from<br>preparing common questions I probably meet, showing my unique skills and knowledge<br>is the key to success. An Interview is just like a conversation and everyone<br>involved it hopes to learn some new and fantastic things, such as cutting edge<br>technology and methodology, especially when interviewing a top position of a<br>great technical company. Thus, paying more attention on proving myself unique<br>will pay off. After all these top companies are looking for great talents and<br>you have to provide enough evidences on it.</p>
<p>The most important<br>thing during the interview process is showing my passion. Some vivid examples<br>can be given and discussed with the interviewer, for instance, it is a good way<br>to tell them which website I learn testing theory and skills from. Designing and<br>developing testing platform is another way to express my passion on testing,<br>after that I can discuss some details with my interviewer. It is better to<br>explain why I chose to do this and how these knowledge and experience can add<br>values for my work.</p>
<p>All in all, trying<br>to dominate the whole interview process is essential and showing your strengths<br>and talents helps the interviewer define your capability to a great extent.  </p>
