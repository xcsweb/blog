Bai Fangli had moved the<br>whole China but could hardly touch the jury of Affecting China until six years<br>after his death. At the time when Bai donated a large sum to education<br>supporting the poverty-stricken students, the government had denied the existence of poor students for they had been under aid of the so-called relief fund. So the jury<br>had to take the same stand with the authorities on this issue. They thought Bai<br>had brought shame to the government. The winners must conform to the politically<br>motivated standard of the judging committee.  </p>

But in the case recounted here, the parent and his<br>daughter switched their roles. The father was judged as a drunken driver, but<br>he denied it and lied to the police that it had been his nephew who had driven<br>the car. Because there was no other person in the car except the man and his<br>young daughter, then he continued to fool the police saying that his nephew had<br>just entered the construction site by the road for work. But the later inquiry<br>proved his words false. In the meantime, the little girl confessed to the police<br>that her father had driven the car after drinking wine. She also asked her<br>father in tears to tell the truth immediately. The father had often drunk alone<br>in depression since the divorce from his wife. </p>

Now I happened to know that another pretty girl has become the wife of a man contracting cerebral palsy. Both cases seem to me inconceivable. Both women had something in common. They were against the traditional values on selecting spouses. They disregarded looks, status, family background, etc. They could have married excellent gentlemen only by their delicate features. Why not? Perhaps they have seen through the world affairs. They have realized the uncertainty of some so-called satisfactory marriages and the unreliability of those admirable husbands. Therefore they would rather be engaged to disabled men than accept a prince’s hand.    </p>
