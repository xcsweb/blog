It gradually got warmer around noon. Seeing the bedroom so warm with bright sunlight, I couldn’t help considering cleaning my body and changing my underwear. The fine weather will last at least for a few days according to the forecast. This is what we want for working after son’s departure. He has booked the train ticket back to school the day after tomorrow. Mother has to move to the west room when the kang in the east room is torn open for clearing the ash inside. </p>

Early in the morning, I first heard some explosions of firecrackers not far off. I had mistaken them for the signal of the beginning of a funeral. Soon I realized my misjudgment when more and more crackers exploded with bangs here and there. Then I guessed people must be celebrating the Birthday of the God of Wealth. By the evening the celebration reached high tide. I not only heard the deafening noise but saw the fireworks being set off in the street and smelt the dynamite. </p>

However, outside the sunlight was still fiery.<br>Found a lot of rolled sheets of straw deserted outside the slaughterhouse near our bungalow in the dim light.

It usually have a suddenly shower for the most of the days. This week the rain become heavier and oftenner too.  The worse case is that the clothes can not dry except for the inconvinience.  Otherwise the autumn season should come as I can aware a little bit cool in the midnight. It should be transparent and dry in this lovely season even it looks not like what our previous memory about the autumn season. The weather should be complained because the emotion becomes blue and wet too.  This moment we expect and hope that we can have the shining sunny days. What you give up and what you persist? The hardest is not to make the choice, it is the courage, it is the courage to continue this jouney even there is not much choices.  We can not change something, we can change ourself at least.   </p>
