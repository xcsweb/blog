Sun warms your body, the glittering sunshine coating the pavement, some flesh points through window may ignite in your eye without bothering you. Transparent winds sweeping around you, bounce back and forth briskly.    Flower-bird market, a traditional market, full of stalls along two sides, one after one in order, every store manages to extend space as much as possible to catch greatest sight of you with deliberately layout.     The greenery, the main player, silently greeting you with the sign of enjoying yourself which spontaneously switchs on your potential sensation. You are caught in flower world, most of them you unknown, that doesn`t matter the way you fully appreciate them. The firmness, the delicacy, the colorfulness and magnificence all these lives contain, to some degree sometimes contradictive happen on a life two sides.    My favorite part, the bird, yes, makes a noise and pervades the full street. Smells not good, not clean enough the condition is, but never affects the charisma of them. Their attactive shape, sheen feather, innocent bounce all stagnates your foot. Their soundings, resonant, singing in concert forming a symphony orchestra with their instinctive stylies. Curious about you in the presence of them, may not enough to trigger all the attention of their world, but you just delighted by this vivid world.    The fish, swarms under water, at first in the procession, then arbitrary array of forms in the following, the dumpy brash one heavily tapping the water and splashes onto the road. Their slim fin pretentiously represent their natural gifted, dividing the water into half, the dominance of the world under the water.    All these form a world, strong connectivity with the nature which should be supposed to us.

We highly rely on divert APPs to better function ourself in all ways of life. Believe or not we are dominated by the APPs, adjusted in the way of APP style to gauge the valuation of life in which it makes your life convenient, cost efficiency and gregarious in all the settings. It seems great, is that true?I take the leave of all to unveil the florid cover to bring forth the substance on the table. App, a form of business torrent, actually any word relating with business, the purpose of all activity is profitablity. Time consumption or service charge are two ways the foundation of business pyramid dumped on ourself inevitably. Time consumption APP for you is charge-free, you may think is in your element, not forever. It not charge you, but on advertiser, and the”chargeable service”if they offer, needless to say barely steer its gaze into your side. In general, charge-free App is the most damaging one in which automatically offer you the deduced interesting updates due to your past orbits and keep flashing human instincts by newest contents to force you constantly clicking, it works rightly by using human inborn ingrained foibles. As you guess the conclude, a waste of time in some degrees and become more and more indulgent in this circle. In a word, corruption. Service charge APP is useful to function our life convenience–the brilliant side, opposite is more or less overshadowing in the once worked course of pro-health activities. Comsumption Statistic Survey is formed through all the registered information you unaware filling or done, is another profitability resource of business in which the details of consumer profiles, habbits, orbits to amplify/assembly potential comsumption behavior to profit platform itself or thick-skined to sell to needed supplier, really do disturbing in your life. The most inflamed part is you are trapped, caught in all the processes without any alternative solution or notice.App never naive, so use it wisely.</p>
