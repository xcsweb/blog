In a word, I felt exhausted during the past two weeks, I can&apos;t find any happiness among daily working except tons of work surround me. Sometimes I would like to escape from the really life, but, I know I have no choice except accepting something, because I know I have enough power or capability to change something around me. Especially our company did a bad performance last year resulting in the shrinking welfare accordingly, what&apos;s more, we didn&apos;t pay raise until now that should be supposed to happen at the beginning of this year. The bad condition will continue to the end of this year, that&apos;s why someone wanted to ask for another opportunity outside. One of my colleagues submitted his resignation letter today, I believe that he has made final decision leaving here this time. I knew he was also not happy with working atmosphere here and didn&apos;t develop his strength in working so that he felt frustrated. I don&apos;t know, if he made a good choice for him, at least he gave him a try to pursue a new career outside. So I should congratulate him on his new job.    To be honest, I am a little reluctant to part with him because of good team work with him. I am not sure whether I can meet one guy who can replace him when he left company and can get along with him. Now, it is a big question for me.

It is not a big deal regarding the non-conformance item, I think it is easy to correct it. But, as the nature of our boss, he can continue to talk it among daily meetings at least two weeks. Absolutely, my boss is actual a warmhearted guy except his short-temper and irresolute personality at every critical moment. In my mind, he always complained to us when he met some tough things even we were under his name. From my point of view, no matter how difficult he met, he did not to show us because we were all his subordinates. Because he just past us negative mood without any positive information and if he always demonstrated his kind of working style, it will cause our disgust in a way even cause doubt about his management skill. Anyway, I don&apos;t want to say something regrading my boss&apos;s disadvantage, I should think more his advantage, and then, we can work together happily.

Many still stare at their phones and do not give much attention on the news from the broadcast. Everything seems to be normal and nature. This scene could be found almost everywhere repeatedly performing everyday. When we are involved in phones, it is no room for talk between persons anymore. Instead, we’d like communicating from phones. Putting away phones, there could be nothing. For most ones they even find it hard to greet a single word face to face, such as HEY and HOW IS IT GOING?An inappropriate metaphor is we are caged and isolated from the outside world. Much time is occupied by the phone and the focus of inner mind is likely to evolve into sensitivity and anxiety. Supposing you almost get the phone running out of power and you are about to scan a QR code to pay the bill. What do you feel then? You might feel uneasy. Because you have not kept some cashes. Right, the cashless payment is today’s trending. Meanwhile without a phone we can hardly do anything. We can not read news, connect friends and are not able to get access to online shopping. A quiet guy may be active and good at gossiping on WeChat. While in reality, he or she acts like another person you do not know.</p>

I stayed here with my mom and dad for one night only as usual, as well as a couple of my grandpa’s cousin sister which is different. There is three generation of people in all, including 4 old, 2 middle age and 1 young. Yeah, me.It is always exhausted to take company of my grandparents. On one hand, the huge groove of generation do exist which make it nearly impossible to find a topic satisfy everyone to talk about. This problem are getting more and more worse when I grow bigger, build my own lifestyle and attitudes toward every perspective of living. On the other hand, people’s health get worse when time goes by, propeling them to think about death. My granddad was caught by brain stroke and have some problems with his leg, which bring huge changes to his life. He stays inside all day alone, listening to radio, with no friends, no aim, no favourite, but lots of complaints. Grandma is in good health, but she too has no hobby at all. The only thing she care about is looking after grandpa, mainly three meals a day. Every time we go there, all of us cannot sleep well because of squeezing in the small sofa and different timetable. As a result, mom got headache, dad got impatient mood, grandparents got tiredness. And I am already filled up with mother’s snoring whole night! But they do not allow us to stay in hotel accorading to the old understanding about relatives——–live in hotel means rude and impolite. As the youngest one in this family, the only thing i could do is to follow others arrangement. The same with this time——Another 2 olds must be taken good care of. My father is a typical traditional man who wants to take control of me and mom all the time but fail a lot. And he is bad at technique of communication, always make others feel bad by his controler’s beviouer, mindless words and costive thinking. Mom has given up arguing with him lone ago, espically confronted with the olds. But I’m still unhappy and tired.Because of another two people, Grandma let my family sleep in a neibours’ room instead, which expend the inconvinence to two family. I had a headache because of mom’s snoring and unfamilier hard pillow, but I have to go to the nearby playing park which is said to be beautiful this time as an entertainment of the old in the morning. Then bear the nasty lunch made by grandma using food left last night with the awful sense of disgust led by headache. Then put up with the noisy music and talk all way back to home.After entering my familiar city, the old couple invited my family to dinner as a gratitude, but they used me as mainly costumer in excuse. All I want was to go home and rest at once! Mom and dad were tired as well, so dad send plenty of  embrassing words throughout the meal. He came home and went to bed at once. But I still have my today’s learning schedule remained to be done!The focus of problem is not age in reality, but the person’s attitudes towards life and knowledge! I found in the end.</p>

For<br>example, some companies recruit software test engineers and others publish<br>these jobs as QA/QC engineers. How could we define the responsibility of QA? I<br>think QA is the person who tell the whole team how about the quality of our<br>products in every steps.</p>
<p>To assess the quality of a product, it is necessary<br>to define important quality indicators for the software process and the<br>product. For example, bugs in the smoke test show the quality on the submitting<br>step, number of bugs per 1000 code lines give developers advices to improve<br>their developing quality. </p>
<p>Thus,<br>software quality metrics are the basis of software QA, which helps us know<br>current product and process quality and gives us clear goals to improve them. Before<br>setting about doing concrete testing tasks, it is better to spend some time on<br>measuring the quality of product and process. It is crucial to understand priorities<br>of all kinds of testing tasks. </p>
<p>With<br>clear aims and efficient ways to improve, testing will become more efficient<br>and valuable.</p>
