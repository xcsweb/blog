A new project will be on running on next round trial-run but, we will do lots of preparations before starting. The first thing we need do is to find proper glue agent for coating process, I believe that it is not an easy job even we put into two manpower for this single item, on this item makes me head-pain is that I worry about it may cause conflict during daily working between guys who should be working well together, due to it will involve personal opinion even interests with suppliers, that it is not what I want to expect on this case. Unfortunately, I am the one of two guys who currently involve in this case. Of course, I will try best to avoid unhappy things on the whole process, currently, the guy with me has a good relationship than others in the department, as plan, he will gradually drop out this case until I take over it from his hand. But, based on actual situations, on the one hand, I can&apos;t take of this case by myself, because I get in touch with this case halfway, not at the beginning of this project. On another hand, he may not want to quit this case, at least don&apos;t quickly quit due to he will take another case that he really doesn&apos;t want to take.     Now, all things are still on going with under control. I do really hope it can run as plans.

The lab has a bigger area than our GM&apos;s office and only three equipment there. The most important is that it always silent. I can&apos;t stand the gossip of the office women any more . The talk always about shopping, food, pop stars and small household affairs and it may last all day. A girl even can talk with herself about all her work.  Maybe that&apos;s the generation gap or I am getting elder.  I prefer to bury myself in my work in a silent environment. Or I talk some meaningful topics for me with my colleagues occasionally , such as history, economic, culture, and so on.     I know it&apos;s not good for disappearing from office for a long time.  But the silent environment is a important thing for me. May be I will stay in office sometimes to show my exist.

I know there is no shortcut for English level improved, but, I can get progress step by step.    Nowadays, I think I should quickly familiarize those requirements and specifications from customers, actually, I am not similar with that of it. It will cost more time to digest those content after work that means I can hardly have time to read the detailed content during daily work because of too many tasks occupy my working time, I need to well organize my working time if I don&apos;t want to work overtime.

Nowadays we just type characters by the input method which is usually referred as Pinyin. We do not have to memorize too much on each single character, we only need to know its pronunciation and then use pinyin to select the wanted character.This is quite convenient and makes us faster to input and edit. The side effect I argue is the lame writing. It implies most of us can not write well by the means of a pen or something like that. We are stuck if we want to write down some by hands. We may either forget the exact strokes or do not remember which character is the right one we should choose. Another downside  is the decline of writing. It means we do not write good looking characters because we do not touch a pen too long. What a bad experience when we are asked to fill in some forms by hands. If it is necessary we can spend some time doing the exercises. We do not have to be a calligrapher, we are just to be sure we can use a pen to write well in some occasions. During the practice, our minds clam down and to be more focused. At least it can help us escape from the overusing of electronic products. It is bad for eyes if we stare on a phone or a computer screen too long. It is time to free eyes.</p>

I almost stayed at home all day because it’s scared outdoor.Thinking about the past year, it’s a bit uncomfortable. I resigned from Datayun last summer, then I took a gap before attending another company.That was not a routine period, compared with workday before. I read several books in those days unemployed. From that experience, I thought a lot about life and family. It was a bit difficult to stay alone without some communication with others. Fortunately, I had two mates in the house.We insisted on communicating with each other and playing badminton regularly.I find that I have lost some memory in vocabulary, maybe I should spend more time in English.Best wishes to us~   </p>

<p>Between Wuzhizhou Island to Lin shui is only 80 kilometres<br>away, one of friend had been there before, so four of us renting one car for a<br>day just enough, the diver was a local young boy, he was waiting us at the<br>entrance of our community at the early morning, travel light is the best way<br>for one day, only one small bag and some finger foods and water, as we were<br>told foods and beverages on the island is extremely expensive.</p>
<p>To the island we had to take the passage ship which<br>was taken about 15 minutes, the ticket is 144 yuan including round trip, and we<br>had to pay other 80 yuan for trolley bus which is stopped as you want, the<br>meaning in the island no any vehicles except this kind of bus, it is good for<br>green environment. The bus was going the island around, I was a little frighten<br>when I was on the bus, I cannot make a nice photo and due to it was too fast<br>even I told the driver, Please slowly, he said the speed of it is limitation,<br>otherwise the next one will follow closely, any way the view is beautiful, I<br>pressed the photo as quickly as I can to catch any corners of the view, luckily<br>I was seating at the side, easy to take the full photo.</p>
<p>The sunshine day it was, the blue sky with the blue<br>sea within the same colour and in one picture, any corners of the photo like a<br>postcard, I was so happy go out with my friends who know how to make a good<br>photo, and they have enough patient for your different poses in one site. If Tiger<br>with me to be there, for sure I cannot have many satisfaction photos, due to he<br>was less of sense for the picture.</p>
<p>We visited Lover Valley and Mazu temple, those place<br>have their own stories. Good luck for lovers, they can be falling in love for<br>ever at the place, the temple is bless with safeness for all fishers and people.</p>
<p>It is a really beautiful place I have never seen before;<br>the time is too short, the seaside and the air I really was missing there till today.<br>Please see my pictures I wanted to share with you all.   </p>

Yan An is the old revolutionary base area. I<br>have been to some red areas in China with my previous company before, but YanAn<br>I haven’t been to yet, and there is a very famous pagoda to be the symbol of<br>the place, I really want to take the picture in there.</p>
<p>After wedding, the bridegroom’s brother was so kind<br>and he would like to be our guide to YanAn by car, due to he knew the way of<br>the destination and it was much easy for the stranger without any direction<br>except GPS to be helped. The traffic was not smoothly as we expected, the road<br>was fully occupied by many big trucks on the way, so we almost took about three<br>or four hours to be there, we first found the motel near the base, and ready to<br>visit at the next morning.</p>
<p>The famous pagoda has been showed in front of us at<br>the sunny day, it is totally nine floors with 44 meters height, unfortunately<br>it was repaired recently, that’s why we did not go upstairs. There are not so<br>many people in the park at the early morning, so we walked around slowly to<br>taste the feeling there, a big party flag came into my eyes under the pagoda. There<br>was a board with some words of Party statement, I am so proud to be a party<br>member. Just by the chance I was trying to raise my hand and reading the word<br>by word loudly to swear again. I knew Tiger had taken the photos and videos to<br>record for the golden moment as well. How wonderful time I had! It was a<br>meaningful trip to Shan Xi.</p>

These days he<br>went to swim and go out in normal, this morning he left home after breakfast to<br>work by foot, nothing wrong with him, I was told that just sitting in front of<br>computer for a while, and then He cannot stand up by himself. He has never<br>happened like this before. </p>
<p>This was still not attention to him, in the evening he<br>was the very important appointment dinner with his clients which has booked at<br>the long time ago, He still insisted to attend it although I have strong reason<br>with him maybe next day or asked somebody instead. It follows that, He can not<br>get up from the bed at the next morning, his body was hardly moved. He has<br>known the serious problems, He called his friends and his sister for helps<br>immediately. After a few calls, He was ready in hospital by day, He asked me to<br>take some stuffs daily used be hospitalized.</p>
<p>The driver took us to there on time, I was holding him<br>slowly to waiting the doctor coming, the doctor we knew was a really busy, and<br>the long meeting was taken about an hour, but we want to get him, we had to do<br>it. not bad with the help of his friends in the hospital, he has simply<br>checking on his body, and let him to making unclear magnetism and B scanning for<br>detail examine. I can see it is totally different if you know somebody for help<br>in the hospital, everything is getting smoothly and quickly, I remembered I went<br>to the hospital for CT checking in one week ago, the reservation was made after<br>one month later. But today just asked somebody who worked in there helped, what<br>we wanted everything finished in a half day.</p>
<p>The medical report was not too bad, the waist was need<br>to has the operation the suggest by the doctor, the disease was very normal as<br>his ages, but just because of Chinese New Year, maybe after the holiday, he can<br>come the hospital again detail information, I was just reassurance after whole morning<br>running around in the hospital. </p>
<p>Betweenness he is hardly walk right now, I borrowed a wheel<br>chair from his father for the moment. Or maybe a walking stick is easy and<br>helping for him. </p>
