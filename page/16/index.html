I walked about 20 minutes to a post station and sent a letter to an online friend by regular mail. The girl at the station threw me a kind of curious look but she didn’t say anything. There was no stamp, and the girl collected the post fee, which is 1.2 yuan, through QR code. So, it was not exactly like the old days. But still, precious memories have all been brought up.This whole idea came out of Shirley, dear leader of our learning group. Honestly, when I first heard it, I was like, with so many much more effective and faster ways, who would go back to writing a letter? But when I settled down, writing the letter with a pen, walking to the post station and mailing it, it felt so different.It’s not just about nostalgia, it’s about slowing down and communicating with each other in old ways, where we don’t rush, we don’t hurry up, we pause and think, where we see people as human being not just a social media profile.Perhaps one day there would be no such things as a regular mail. Perhaps in the not so distant future, we might have faster and incredible ways to communicate. When we want to talk with someone, we simply close our eyes, and through some magic chip in our brains, we could appear together anywhere we want, either on exotic beech, or in tropic jungles, and sat down to have a nice “face-to-face” talk. However, it would not be the same. And those feelings when you wrote a letter would be always there, stored safely in our memories.</p>

Here I’m just trying to<br>write down how I feel about them. So, it’s just personal and I certainly don’t<br>mean to pass judgements or cause any troubles. </p>
<p>No.1 Trade War. Honestly, it makes me feel<br>uneasy. I’m pacifist and anything related to the word war makes me<br>uncomfortable. I<br>understand that some differences are hard to settle down through negotiations, especially<br>through political negotiations. But is it a lose-lose situation really the only<br>way out? Okay it’s really a big topic. Right now for the most of us, the real<br>concern about this news probably is just how it is going to affect the stock<br>market–, I mean if you happen to have some money in it. But for the long run,<br>who knows? </p>
<p>No.2 Bullying<br>at school. It’s insane. I mean, stabbing-a-ten-year-old boy to death in front<br>of your daughter, and you call it to protect her from school bullying? This big<br>story ignites a national dialogue about bullying at school and I understand how<br>we all hate it, but as a mum, I could never understand this man’s behavior. Honestly,<br>it chills me to the bones to see so many netizens even applauding for him, describing<br>him as sort of a hero. Honestly, I don’t know which one scares me more, school<br>bullying or this twisted celebration for murdering a boy in his own class room.<br>Even if when violence is the only way to curb violence—which I seriously doubt<br>it, pick up your target right, find his father to have an one-on-one fight. </p>
<p>No.3 WeChat<br>New Rule. Okay, it’s great for our learners. I bought another course from Qingke<br>as soon as I knew that I didn’t need to share it in my moments to get full<br>refund. I know our social medium has already become ad-riddled hellscapes, but I<br>never expected that “Education” would become the first target to make a change.<br>When I open my moments to find the others learning records all over, it’s a little<br>bit annoying, but at the same time it pushes me forward. Personally, I think it’s<br>so much better than to see false news and other ads flooding your screen. </p>
