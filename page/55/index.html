And this afternoon, it started to rain again. Neither so cold nor so warm, I just feel it is fine to start my time being home. I was asked what I was planning to do during this holiday. I replied by smiles: “Read something.” Besides, I still keep strolling around. I do not consider putting on weight by eating a lot. Simple life always is the best companion I am glad to be with. “How do you spend your time in the festival?”, another question would be asked. I say that it is quite as usual as normal. I do not have to be hard on what it is supposed to be. It also could get there by choosing another way.Tonight is extraordinarily quiet. As if it were into sleep. Good night.</p>

Before<br>Chinese New Year I followed my daughter to send an order at the App, I would<br>like to decorate my home at Spring Festival, so the first order might delivery<br>before NY.</p>
<p>Busy days of this long holiday, I almost forgot the order<br>of flower. This morning when the courier knocked my door and told me this was<br>the flower, only then I remembered the order. The smell has been directly into<br>my face, I opened it immediately, I was full of water in the bottle quickly, I<br>arranged flowers into the bottle piece by piece, even it was the late delivery,<br>I hardly called the name of each one, but colourful charming flower was making<br>me so romance. </p>
<p>I believe the flower can bring me good mood of the<br>day, Can see the flower is making me sitting down in front of my computer,<br>pushing me to write the blog of her, to tell the her feeling is coming to my<br>home never too be late, anytime it is welcomed always by anyone of the world<br>and anytime. </p>

The main reason is that we think it too much and finally mess it up. It is not that easy to make judgement if there is no evidence to show the right decision. When it comes to face troubles, we do not exactly undersand that actions we make today is probably to make a big difference tomorrow. Of course, we do not know. That is the beauty of life.Be yourself, do not be a zombie. Do not admire somebody else, you are the best one with unique inner world. Time records your growth and makes the history.</p>

At 35th<br>anniversary party in Lidu at last year, Cost control should be including<br>office, storeroom and receiving about 15 people, so pity was that I was just to<br>see a few of them.</p>
<p>Regina she moved to Japan and married with Japanese<br>for thirty years and even I have few contacts with her and other two girls was<br>only at the special case or holidays for greeting in wechat. You know the<br>people leave far away to other country, they may be so emotional than others<br>including Regina.</p>
<p>The last week She was back to China only for a<br>week, She would like to invite our people have the dinner to meet all of them. Unfortunately<br>the meeting day was Oct 31th. Any way, our girls would like to date in advance,<br>Mary was busy with her work in the afternoon, other three of us were walking<br>around the home building even we were hardly to find each corner, but still<br>feel so close and welcome, chatting, drinking to make the time to stop.</p>
<p>Regina gave some small gifts to each one from<br>Japan, Mary brought some desserts from her hotel, Yao our leader and organizer<br>was taking two bottles of Red wines. Friendship Hug to be the first act to see<br>each other, It was really long time no see, Li Xin and Zheng came late because<br>of busy for month end closing. There is only Li Xin a little bit strong than<br>before, for others no any changes at all. We were counting 8 brothers in store according<br>to ages were so handsome and who is who. </p>
<p>Lili she was the only one girl in store. That’s<br>why we have five girls and six boys big meeting at the night. I was so<br>impressive till today hardly to release the moment we have. We should cherish and<br>see our photos how wonderful! Compare with the old one and new one.</p>

I do self inspection<br>sometime why my speed is slower than my frog swim, it should not be like that, maybe<br>my arms are not straight enough, or maybe my footwork is not in right way. I<br>checked one reference report from one swimming material for female, my result<br>is only in middle level, but I have enough staying power and I have loved and<br>kept swimming for many years, why my performance is not my expectation.</p>
<p>This morning I went to swimming pool as usual, maybe<br>it was too early, nobody there, the pool like making a block booking for myself,<br>when I was so happy to see the quiet pool, but I found I forgot bring my<br>swimming glasses and cap, how come? I have never swam without the both, it took<br>much time if I went back home to take it. I was trying to find the cap at the<br>corner in the locker room instead; luckily there was the one, although it was<br>too small for my long hair, no any choice. </p>
<p>I have never swam without my swimming glasses, I cannot swim when I was<br>in the water, I had to close my eyes like a blind dog, but gradually I fit the<br>situation and swimming freely to forward my body as fast as I can. I checked my<br>code water, I cannot believe only 25 minutes for 1km, which is my new record<br>for sure, it was full of surprise just by the accident, the story told us if<br>you want to reach the gaol which you did many times before, but always come to<br>nothing, then you might try thinking other ways to go, the big surprise will<br>come to you. Please believe me.</p>
