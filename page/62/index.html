But my parents who are both farmers worried about that very much . And there are no any indications that he will try his best to get a girlfriend. We worked in the same city, so I always be asked to help him.  Unfortunately, we both don&apos;t have a big social circle as engineers.  So, I can&apos;t do anything except meet him and talk with him frequently as a friend.        He has a good education background and a good job.  He is a nice boy in general althouth he is introverted.  I know he still want to get a right girl as his girlfriend. But it&apos;s a difficult thing for an introverted engineer in a technical company.  And he don&apos;t want to get a girl to marry until he find his right girl.        Today, when I talked with my colleague I learned that one of her classmates is still single too. The girl looks nice and has the similar age, education back ground,  work experience and even we come from the same province.  Me and my colleague both happy about that because it is not common to meet two people with the similar conditions.  We think that there is a big opportunity for them to be the right people.  We exchange the basic informations of them and want to introduce them to each other.          I am exciting  to wait for their feedback, just like I was waiting for a girl&apos;s answer when I am still a boy.         I hope it will be helpful, athough I know it isn&apos;t a easy thing.         Best wishes to them.

Are you have a good festival with your lover or friends. But it just a usual day for me. I seldolm celebrate a festival in my life. The birthday, valentine&apos;s day , wedding anniversary , nationday, and even the new year. And prepare a gift is a headache too. Festival is just means days of vacation for me. My wife angry with me for that for a long time. But she has been used to that now. I think that.      Maybe the festerval give us a good chance to express our love and friendship. I am no doubt that is a good thing. But why we have to do that in the festival. We can give a gift or have a romantic dinner with lover at anytime if we want. We also can play games with our children,  accompany with our parents and have a party with friends.  The best gift is the things what they want. It&apos;s a embarrassing thing to received a dislike gift. Of course, they may be shy to tell you what they want. But I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a big problem between family members and good friends. And we are not so poor and can afford a gift in the everyday life.      I am not a romatic man in my wife&apos;s words. And I am not good at finding what others want. That maybe an excuse for me to deny to celebrate festivals. And I don&apos;t think we have to express our love and friendship in festivals. On the contrary , we can do that everyday. A surprise may become a embarrssing thing . So, baby, tell me what you want. I&apos;ll take it to you. A gift or just a warm hug. Everyday is a festival.

So buying a car became a topic in my family although I don&apos;t think it&apos;s  not so convenient as it seemed.   I take part in a driver training class and got my driver license in the end of 2018, because my wife want to buy a car and she don&apos;t dare to drive by herself at the beginning.      After is got my drive licese, I spend a lot of time to learn about the knowledges and want to select a suitable car for us in so many brands.  I almost find the right car for us in these days.  But we have a conversation about the necessary and cost of a car before we make our decision. That made us hesitate:      Why we want to have a car: Most people around us have had cars.The e-bike can&apos;t carry all the family out because of the second child&apos;s coming.It&apos;s a long distance from our home to my wife&apos;s office. Have a car will save more than a half time to get to her office.We plan to have more travel with the children in the future.      The weakness to have a carThe cost of keeping a car is expensive:  the cost to buy a car is about 150,000 yuan ; the oil for each year is about 10,000 yuan ; the assurance and maintenance fees is about 10,000 yuan per year; the cost to have a located parking space is 70,000 yuan.  And there are parking cost in the office or destination, traffic rules punishments and fines.  The total cost if more than 450,000 yuan if a car can operation 10 years ( 15,0000+ 10,000*10+ 10,000*10+ 70,000+ others cost =450,000).  It will cost us 45,000 yuan each year.  We won&apos;t cost so much if we go by a taxi.Because there are so many cars in the city now. It&apos;s not easy to find a parking space not only in my community but also in office and other place.  Most saving time will be spending on finding a parking space.It&apos;s not so difficult to take a taxi.  And driving is a tired thing especially for a long distance driving.     In general, it is not so necessary for a family such as us to have a car .   If we want to go out , just take a taxi.      Maybe there are somthing I missed.  Could you give me some advice?  should we will buy a car or not?      Thanks

Shichahai has been the most approachable and comfortable scenic spot. It is very near to the central axis of from Drum Tower to Qianmen, and also free to tourists. However, all my previous trips were spent in summer with gentle breeze and green tree, and no sightseeing took place in winter. Thus, I decided to try a different experience. The willow tree seemed to be dry and withered with dangling branches in the chilling air. On the distant stone arch bridge there was a little travelers. It unfolded a different picture from that in spiring and summer: heavy, gray and cold. I chose to stand against the rail of Wanning Bridge to take a full and front picture.   It is a right and full picture of Jinding Bridge.  Among many bridges in Shichahai, the most famous is Yinding Bridge, it quenched my thirst to pay more attention to other bridges for a long time. Different<br>from Yinding Bridge that ever ranked one of Small Yanjing Eight Attractions, Jingding<br>Bridge never took place until 2001 when a bridge was built in the eastern outlet<br>of Shichahai lake. Hou Renzhi, the professor in Peaking University, was<br>assigned to give a name to the new bridge. Considering the necessary to be popular<br>and align with the scenery of Shichahai, Hou advised to name the bridge as<br>Jingding Bridge, Jingding means “golden ingot”,which corresponds to Yinding (sliver<br>ingot).     The setting sun crept over the tip of willow branch, setting off a bleak and drear picture in the royal garden. Many times, I  marveled at how magnificent the setting sun in the Forbidden City, while I still felt another kind of grandeur here.</p>

Of course, it is a good chance to find a new job after bonus collected in Jan, because, it can greatly minimize the loss after you join in a new company. To be frank, it struck me a little bit when I knew these colleagues would leave us, after all, we got together with each other for several years. I have to say, there are some unreasonable problems confused us a lot under current policy in company, unfortunately, the top management doesn&apos;t realize these even after the employees&apos; representative bring the problems into the desk, our company is pretty small than other manufacturing, there are total one hundred and fifty employee, so the real top management is the general manager who would like to grab power in his hand closely, in a word, he would like to know everything happened around him. It causes the problem that the manager of each department dare not make any decisions without his permission. And the terrible problem caused is the managers have a few authorities in front of their subordinates so that the relationship is not harmonious between them.    I never expect this situation could be resolved completely, just follow up one of my colleagues said, if you can&apos;t adapt here working atmosphere, the best choice is to go away with any hesitation.
