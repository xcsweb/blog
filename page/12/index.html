It was warm yesterday but it gets bitterly cold and<br>sleety today. I had to wear a scarf, a pair gloves and a hat that can cover my ears. On<br>my way to school, I spotted a few farmers begin burning the remains of the dry corn<br>stems and leaves in their fields in preparation for the approaching sowing. As I<br>returned more and more peasants joined the burning which is banned by the local<br>government. The local people have always been dealing with the remnants of the<br>dead plants in this way. The government only knows to issue orders but fails to<br>direct how to solve the problems. Now so many people should challenge the authorities<br>and violate the law and discipline, would the government punish these offenders<br>as it has declared ?</p>

Both sides often criticize each other face to face or privately. Therefore most daughters-in-law have determined to live apart from their mothers-in-law even before their wedding. Some single men can hardly find wives when they insist on living with their parents after marriage. As long as the parents keep healthy and can take care of themselves, they may live separately from their married children temporarily. But the children had better live as close to their parents as possible and make frequent visits to them in case the seniors need help. </p>

The Chinese National Revolutionary Army retreated without any resistance giving up the northeast completely. The Republic of China fixed today for National Humiliation Day.

He was hasty in writing and never revised his works before put to press. The popularity of Don Quixote ranks second only to the Bible. As soon as it appeared, it received a great welcome from the public. This aroused the envy and attacks of his counterparts. Although he lived in poverty all his life, he was always sanguine about the future. Up to now, no satisfactory translation of Don Quixote has been found. </p>

<p>活到老学到老，在49岁的河南原阿姨的眼里，这不单单只是一个口号。In last December, she took part in the entrance<br>exams for postgraduate schools with her son. After the announcement of the test<br>scores, the son was admitted to Fudan University as graduate student, and Aunt Yuan also<br>gained admission to Guangxi<br> University as<br>postgraduate majoring in Chinese international education.</p>
<p>在去年12月份，原阿姨和儿子一起考研，最终考研的成绩下来之后，儿子被录取为复旦大学的研究生，而原阿姨也被广西大学的汉语国际教育专业录取为研究生。A lad committed suicide<br>by jumping from a bridge just before his mother. What’s<br>wrong with the domestic education？ </p>

But I knew brother urgently needed help now for his trade because the Festival for the Dead is approaching. If I had not been ill yesterday, I would have offered him help. So I headed for his home after taking a little porridge in the early morning. On my arrival I saw brother was loading sacrificial paper onto the van for delivery.
