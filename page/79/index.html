<p>Busy for two months since Sept to end of Nov 2018 for<br>new house property, during this time, I cannot go anywhere just in case I have<br>to appear personally in the governments or in the public if necessary, due to<br>it was under my name. After everything was done, finally I could have the long<br>breath and I really need to some relaxes. And there was other reason Tiger was<br>invited by one of his uncles to attend the birthday party at the end of year to<br>Zhan Jiang city in Guang Dong province, why not we took the leave without delay<br>for the travelling. We would like to visit the bridge between HK and Macao, before<br>we left, quickly asking for the passport for it. </p>
<p>We were told that at the end of the year, there was the<br>custom in Zhan Jiang to wish a good future. The day was inviting friends and<br>relatives coming to the home for the celebration, setting off firecrackers and<br>having the big meal. If the people coming from the long way they will be appreciated<br>and happy together.</p>
<p>Everything almost plan good for this trip, I knew that<br>my childhood friends would like going to Hai Nan province during this time. Why<br>not I can join them it is not difficult, just do it. I will fly to my friend<br>after New Year, Luckily I did not book the return ticket yet. At the meanwhile<br>Tiger had the plan with his uncle to Thailand for long time ago, without me<br>accompany is easy and more relaxing. </p>

According to my learning records, I have completed 583 classes and practiced English communication for 291 hours. Chawee, Clief, and Cardi, they are my favorite teachers. They have left 51Talk one by one. But I haven’t graduated from 51talk yet. My English is still poor.  Sometimes, I think the reason why my English is not yet improving yet is because of my learning ability. However, I know I excel in other fields. I think, my learning method doesn’t suit me. I believe, with the right method, I can master the language in no time because I am an experienced teacher, too. Moreover, I found the main reason as to why my language skills hasn’t improved yet. I have no one to practice the language with. In other words, I don’t have an atmosphere for learning English.Thanks to my other teacher, Jhoan, In my opinion she is an excellent teacher and she is willing to help me. I like the way she communicates in English. She speaks in a clear and relaxing manner. It is pleasing to the ear, like the breeze or the sound of water spring. Sometimes I can’t catch up with her but her body language helps me understand her better. Now we can have some simple communication. I feel happy whenever I speak to her. Because she never makes me nervous and she always encourages me to express myself.I hope I can make great progress with her help. Finally, we can get into barrier-free communication situation.Corrected by Teacher Jhoan</p>

I was running from the sunlight warm New Year’s Eve to the windy chilly fifth day of new year. A mischievous circle of six days from 6 miles to 14 miles gave this holiday a sort of sense of ritual.  Honestly, the last running was really a pain in the neck, and I wanted to quit in the first mile. It’s too cold and windy, I could feel the heaviness seeping through my whole body. Now I was just glad that I made it.  When you want to do something, ask yourself three questions first: one, what do you want? Second, why do you want? Third, how are you going to get it? In this case, I know what I want. That is running a half-marathon. I know why I want it, because it is cool to do something everyone thought that you couldn’t, it is great to be able to push your limits, especially after being beaten down so many times. And I know how I am going to get it, by moving forward every single time.  The year of pig, I am ready and I am coming. PS: Another thing I do everyday is daily writing. I want to keep a record of my life in written English, because in this way I write my blues away, I connect and bound with the others. And I know how I am going to get it, by daily writing in EMF Daily Must. Welcome to join me: </p>

<p>If everything goes well, I would run<br>half-marathon, my husband and my son would be in happy run-5 km three months<br>later. Of course, it’s a mission impossible for now, but we have three-plus<br>months to go. </p>
<p>Miracle certainly could happen in 125 days.<br>I believe if you want something badly enough, that wish would find the power to<br>call the thing into being. Therefore, having faith really means a lot. </p>
<p>As days and weeks and months stretch into<br>the unknown future, time would start blurring and blending and eventually getting<br>lost in the distant future. To set up a flag, from this point of view, is<br>really important. </p>
<p>Speaking of spirit-over-matter issue, how<br>could we forget about Marvel and DC?</p>
<p>While everyone is talking about Avengers:<br>Endgame, today I’d like to stay with Aquaman. </p>
<p>For years, Kingdom of Atlas only exist in my dreams.<br>As a legend, it has inspired my curiosity and fueled my imaginations in the<br>most fantastic way. </p>
<p>I mean, lost culture, fallen island, buried secrets,<br>and grandeur ocean, one alone is enough to grip my attentions and when all are<br>rolled into one, bang! You bet that it could set my imaginations totally free. </p>
<p>Mr. Wen and the team behind “Aquaman” has done such a<br>great job that this movie has reached beyond my wildest dream about Atlas could<br>go. I’m a crazy dreamer, so that really says something. Mr. Wen, the man who<br>was behind some most scary movies, incorporated horror element into sci-fic and<br>he stretched it so far that he actually created something tantalizingly beauty,<br>the kind of beauty that make all your hair stand. </p>
<p>He really throws an awful lot into this mind-blowing<br>two hours: whirling underwater world, eye-catching creatures, attractive<br>customs and people, and spectacular scenes. </p>
<p>The story is simple. But in a movie like that the<br>story is often upstaged by the world it presents to its audience. Who cares<br>about the story?</p>
<p>So if someone asked me what Atlas could be possibly<br>like, I would say: Go and try Aquaman.</p>

To avoid being late in morning, I rise about 6 o’clock a.m. and arrive in subway station in 6:45. Meanwhile, I usually do some preparation of the day such as washing up, picking up several belongings and buying breakfast, and after then walk to subway station in 15 minutes.The subway carries me to the station near the place of my job in 75 minutes. Another 30 minutes by bus finally takes me to the right place. The time of arriving is about 8:30 a.m. Since I got up, two and a half hours have passed.The working time from 8:30 to 16:30 of the day is often quite busy, with nearly no time of rest.In afternoon, it takes about 100 minutes in common transport, same as that of morning.As mentioned above, I spend more than 3 hours a day (equal to 200 minutes) in the journey of going to work and coming back home, not including overtime hours. For me, the 200 minutes seem like the water squeezed out of wetting sponge, and either to be used, or to be wasted for nothing. The question is how to use the time in common transport efficiently. I think about it every day. </p>

<p>Last Sunday, I saw Nanchang Marathon from TV<br>and hear the hostess say: “Indeed we see the marathon race around Gan River<br>reflects the beautiful scenery of Nanjing…”I was then convinced she had<br>hosted the Nanjing Marathon live broadcast the week before. It reminds me of<br>the trip of Mr. Karl Wilson, business editor of the Sunday Morning Post to<br>Nanjing in August 1993. I was with him for a four-day visit and coverage of<br>several selected local economic sectors. A month after his return, he sent me a<br>letter and the newspaper with his article “Nanjing ‘Neck of Dragon’”  published on its business review page, and asked me to comment on his report. I wrote back to<br>say how I appreciate his stories which enabled me to have an insight of the economic reform in my city, and then I did not forget to add at the end of the letter: “It’s only that my city is dotted to the<br>position of Nanning in the inset map of the country.” </p>
<p>There are slips of tongue. There are slips of<br>pen. “To err is human”. And that is a good excuse of my making mistakes in<br>daily life.</p>

Tiger is the same he has a wonderful wish that<br>he would like to have an book talking about himself at the long time ago. Starting<br>from he joined the army and then, following his career path which he had<br>changed many kinds of works from state owned company to the international hotel,<br>and return back to China Netcom, finally he is running his own property company<br>with his brother till today.</p>
<p>To be honest, I know he is lazy to write<br>anything on paper or on the computer, so I don’t think he can do it. But some<br>days before he told me his idea and he found “one girl” can ghostwrite for him<br>totally, I don’t care who is the girl, I am regard with kindly tolerance as<br>long as somebody can help him instead of I do, you know it is really big work<br>on writing. To be his wife I promised him I can be a good assistant to collect<br>the information to be supporting for the book, including the pictures, the<br>stories of his life, only I was poor on his works and his company information.</p>
<p>At the last week I was starting to collect digital<br>photos from my computer and digit out from old album, and then scan it to cell<br>phone one by one. How can I tell the story and let the write knew? I think my Chinese<br>is not good enough to write the book, that’s why I prefer to take the record by<br>voice messages according to each photo, some of stories without picture, talking<br>about Tiger for me no need to rehearsal of record, each stories I can remember<br>each clearly, everything in my mind. </p>
<p>I have collected about 40 pictures, that are meaning it will have at least 40 stories to tell in voice, and then sent the<br>files by mail to writer, She will according to my story to write her words. It<br>is not too difficulties for me and I would like to do anything for Tiger.<br>Hopefully some day later the book can be available to our readers. </p>

May be<br>the traffic, everybody knows that the capital of Beijing’s traffic just likes<br>baby cry, very normal, but if I go for a meeting to somewhere, I prefer taking<br>the subway to avoid it. If I have some urgent things around me by the last<br>minute, I have to tell my partner in any ways as I can, text of wechat, voice<br>message or a call directly. It will be never happened to me there is no any<br>reasons for the late.</p>
<p>Hopefully everybody here learns from me at this point.<br>Thanks!</p>

What&apos;s more, the customer will stay here for nearly two weeks. Of course, we have to face customer on some critical topics especially some key parameters and specification, we would like to bring forward our suggestion on some unreasonable requirements and persuade customers to accept our suggestion from a professional perspective. That it is a direction we are looking for. To be honest, our customer is not a stubborn guy, if you can provide convincing evidence, he may accept our suggestion and feedback to headquarters as improvement. Strictly speaking, this time the customer comes to our company as visiting not audit, because, lots of things have not defined yet, both of them needs to reach an agreement to unify the process specification.
