Tiger and I has been to America in year<br>2012 with his sister, even we went to many cities from east of US to the<br>western part, that time we were focus on human landscape and places of<br>historical figures and cultures, invite us to go with them together in October.<br>Yellow park is one of our favorite place all the time, and we were told<br>everything the friend has made the detail schedule including renting the car,<br>the air ticket and hotel or motel, whatever everything is on the paper. We were<br>happy accept the invitation, Hurry up for visa first, due to three months left only.</p>
<p>We are the luck birds, everything is smoothly<br>for visa and EVUS, after confirmed it we were going to booking the ticket. The ticket<br>was from Oct 3rd to Oct 23th, How come the price for round trip from<br>BJ to Los Angeles is only 3000 rmb, and it was the golden holiday must be<br>expensive than others, it is not Dollar for sure, and it is unbelievable! My dear<br>Dannie he was the greatest master of network.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the beginning of September<br>Tiger’s heart attack again, he must be has the operation immediately, one week<br>later, the minimally surgery was done for Tiger in An Zhen hospital which is<br>one of good hospital in China, everything was not bad, only we were worry about<br>Tiger can be suffering the long trip after the heart operation, if we postpone<br>or cancel that we will not be wish, but if we insist on it, if something<br>happened, even we have checked the medical insurance how we can ask for helps<br>if something happened during the trip. The doctor said it should be no problems<br>for the trip if no some urgent cases, takes it easy. Finally I put down my<br>heart gradually.</p>
<p>Dannie gave me a folder with the detail schedules<br>and plans, I was lazy to read line by line, you know if somebody around you is<br>smart and diligent, you might easy to be a lazy man, so we just took our luggage<br>and the passport to follow our friends, starting our three weeks US trip.</p>
</div><hr></div><div class="recent-post-item"><a class="article-title" href="/blog/2019/11/03/Trip_to_Thailand_(part_1)/">Trip to Thailand (part 1)</a><time class="post-meta__date"><i class="fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></i> 2019-11-03</time><span class="article-meta tags"><span class="article-meta__separator">|</span><i class="fa fa-tag article-meta__icon" aria-hidden="true"></i><a class="article-meta__tags" href="/blog/tags/learn-english/">learn english</a></span><div class="content"><p>This family trip was totally plan by my daughter at<br>two months ago with her friends, 7 days trip for one place was long time, but I<br>don’t like travels that were always on the bus. We started off at Sep 2 early<br>morning with small baby by plane, almost 5 hours from T3 to Phuket airport. As<br>order from Lazy Cat agency to pick us up to the hotel on time, so we had very<br>good beginning for this family holiday.</p>
<p>We were early one day come to Thailand than my<br>daughter’s friends, they will only arrive at the second day. The hotel named is<br>Duangjett resort near the sea, I can see it is the nature park with many kinds<br>of tropical plants and flowers which I hardly call the name, because of the<br>hotel is so big, from the lobby to the room we have to call the bell service sent<br>us by the trolley bus, I cannot believe it is only four stars hotel. If in<br>China, it must be six or seven stats service and maybe never happened. So in Southeast<br>Asia countries, the guest was treated like a king or queen, that’s why the most<br>of European likes spenting the holiday in Asia.</p>
<p>So the first day trip to Egg island like daily tour I<br>just like a follower, no any clue how far it was, how dangerous it was? Due to<br>just at one month ago, the ship with 80 peoples was an accident in this area,<br>PeiPeiPei, just forget it, we bring the sun glasses, the cap and swimming suit<br>to pick up the car. The weather was not too bad, a little sunshine in the<br>morning, so we did not take much clothes for the baby. When we went there, we<br>realized in fact the big ship cannot be pulled in to shore, all the customs<br>have to move other small boat, and then getting through a floating bright to<br>shore which is about 30 meters long. It will be continued. </p>
</div><hr></div><div class="recent-post-item"><a class="article-title" href="/blog/2019/11/03/Trip_to_Thailand_(part_2)/">Trip to Thailand (part 2)</a><time class="post-meta__date"><i class="fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></i> 2019-11-03</time><span class="article-meta tags"><span class="article-meta__separator">|</span><i class="fa fa-tag article-meta__icon" aria-hidden="true"></i><a class="article-meta__tags" href="/blog/tags/learn-english/">learn english</a></span><div class="content"><p>The floating bridge was heavily moved, you cannot<br>stand walking smoothly, and there was no handrail, so hardly to move, anyway a<br>little by a little my family were the safe to the shore. </p>
<p>Egg island was not officially opened, due to it was<br>not easy to find the way for the strangers or guests, the entrance was very<br>small out of the way, that’s why there is not so many people there, the sea<br>view is very nature and fresh, and the sand is clean and tidy, there are many small<br>tropical green fish, you can see it clearly in the sea, this place is very good<br>for the children’s family and also very good for the snorkel dive.</p>
<p>The weather was not too bad, the sunshine was not<br>strongly with some cloudy as well, the babies for sure they were starting to<br>play sands with the colourful toys, our adults were swimming and photo shooting<br>do what we like leisurely. </p>
<p>Suddenly the black cloudy was covered the whole sky,<br>the heavily rainy was coming strongly, we were no time to pick our things<br>together, Holding the baby hurriedly to the poor shed, you know the shed at the<br>sea side, it was only a few wooden tables and plastic chairs, the ceiling was<br>leakage everywhere, my daughter was holding the baby with wet bath towel at the<br>corner of shed, we cannot find any safe places, we asked the local people how<br>long the raining can be stopped, they said it was hardly to say, but it was<br>very normal changed the weather like the baby face, after 15 minutes, the<br>raining did not stop, I thought we had to move and find other place for the<br>baby, otherwise I was afraid fear the children, we moving to the other place<br>which was more bigger space and no leakage, I knew my daughter was little worry<br>about the baby, she kept silent no any choice just pray the god.  </p>
<p>Finally the rain was a bit small, the tour guide said<br>we can leave here right now, everybody had to through the floating bridge again<br>to the ship, because of the windy, the bridge was shaken heavily than the beginning,<br>there was a ship which was almost closed for the last guest, my daughter was in<br>front, she was holding the baby, she wanted to catch it, but her steps was hardly<br>move forward, I was holding the grandma at the back, the full picture likes a<br>flea for safety.</p>
<p>Anyway it was a kind of experience, luckily after we<br>were back to hotel with hot bath for the baby, he was good, no any<br>uncomfortable at that time, so we can make our next daily tour.</p>

But this time we did not go to<br>the bar or nightspot, because of we took the baby together, so we only went to<br>some places including Dolphin Bay and riding elephant.</p>
<p>After egg island tension experience, we did not stop<br>our steps for the next daily tour. At the following day as we planned, we went<br>to Banana Beach in the morning, the shape of beach is really like a banana, it<br>is more nature and the water is blue and clean enough, only a few people<br>playing the water with their lovers on the beautiful beach, one of my friend<br>was talking a group photo for us under the sunshine which was I like so much.</p>
<p>The ticket of Dolphin bay we had been booked was at 1pm,<br>we quickly had the local simple lunch and then took the car around 1 hour away.<br>The driver was a really good local guy, my daughter knew him just at the first<br>tour be our driver, and we learn he was a quiet people and keeping his smiling<br>face always, his English was not good, but we can talk each other with the body<br>language for helps, that’s why at the following days tours, we would like him<br>to be our full time driver.</p>
<p>Dolphin show I have seen it in somewhere before, but<br>Dolphin Bay in Phuket is one of biggest modern and update show in the world,<br>seating in the front you have to wear the rain coat, otherwise it must be a lot<br>water to be out, three staffs and one host organized on the stage, at the first<br>they invited your family take the photo with Dolphin on the stage with 400 THB,<br>making some good atmosphere with strong music by the host, and then four of<br>dolphins were dancing on the water, the staff with dolphin was so match playing<br>together in different posts. The baby was so concentration on the show, focus<br>on the action of Dolphin and trying to learn from them. In general this was<br>really good for children.</p>

<p>Anita always persuades me we’d better take the business<br>class if it is over 5 or 6 hours on the plane. I agree totally, but when I compare<br>the price with economic class, you know it is cost a lot. I am a little bit<br>talking myself, maybe next time. And this trip everything was following them. As<br>our ages for long trip I have to prepare more stuff on the plane just in case,<br>I bought the pillows for legs and neck, the small blanket which might lie on<br>the ground if possible. Unfortunately the space of the first line should be<br>keep empty, so everything is useless for my stuff, anyway all well Tiger and I<br>was smoothly on the plane for 11 hours, maybe it was the day time flight.</p>
<p>Los Angeles was our first stop, everybody<br>looked so pale and tired after took off the plane, and for sure sleeping was<br>the first important thing, and release jet lag as early as we can.</p>
<p>Renting the car in Salt Lake city, which is a<br>small city, the service on the counter was so slow and no any efficient at all,<br>and no more car to select except only one grey car parking there. In my imagination,<br>we might rent a red roadster, how cool it is on the west of US! You know we<br>have four people and three big suit cases, this time just forget it.</p>
<p>Xiang Hui he is the youngest one in our team,<br>he and Daniel is the second time self driving travel in US, that’s why they<br>know how to rent the car, what’s the rule in America of traffic, GPS which has<br>to buy in local to set up and down load the map in advance. You know Yellow Park<br>there is no signal for cell phone, that’s why it cannot be guide system. The<br>driving license must be with a translation attached and one car at least two<br>licenses available.  </p>

There are many kind of<br>animals we are hard to call the name, but we had to know enjoy a safe visit and<br>be bear aware, quietly from a safe distance 100 yards from bears and wolves, 25<br>yards from all other animals, the park newspaper lists schedules of ranger-led<br>activities like talks, walks, hikes, demonstrations. </p>
<p>Using geology and vegetation as clues, you can<br>determine key wildlife habitat. Geology, plants and animals interact dynamically<br>over a large region; the mission of the National Park Service is to safeguard<br>national and cultural resources for enjoyment of this and future generations.<br>Please help care for this beautiful place. This youthful landscape gave me so<br>impressive.</p>
<p>The park ‘s clean air, water and natural sounds<br>enhance our visit and quality of habitat for native species, the parkway let<br>you enjoy nature’s sights and sound safely. Stay on trails to protect native<br>vegetation.</p>
<p>Teton Village is the small village, it is very<br>quiet with tidy green grass and some wooden houses for eating and living, where<br>is one of place for every keen skiers and snowboarders every year in the world.<br>Jackson Hole is a small town in the village where is also paradise place for<br>tourists. I like there so much, that’s why I would share my happiness with my<br>friends, so when I sent the message and pictures to wechat of the place, Ya<br>Jing is my friend she told me she has lived this wooden house before, what the<br>wonderful small world is!

We<br>were told at least three or four days to follow the line number 8 every corners<br>of the park if you want to visit it deeply. I can say we were the lucky birds<br>because of snowing in October as beautiful as this are few and far between as<br>local people said, all roads were just opened, seemed that they know and<br>welcome we are coming now.</p>
<p>Let our tourists knows<br>that you may have to book the hotel in advance if you want to live in the park<br>in high seasons, otherwise it is inconvenient in and out by car, Foods and<br>Beverages inside are quite expensive than others.</p>
<p>Each parks before we<br>visit, we would like to go to the service centre first, just let us know some<br>information of park, how and where we can start it, where is the most light spots<br>and features. Unbelievable the signal of cell phone was not good in the park,<br>that means you have to take GPS for guiding.</p>
<p>At the heart of<br>Yellowstone’s past, present and future lies a super volcano, huge volcanic<br>eruptions occurred here, the heat powering those eruptions still fuels the park’s<br>geysers, hot springs, fumaroles and mud pots. Hot springs are the most common<br>hydrothermal features in the park, They vary from frothing mocha-like boiling<br>water to clear and calm pools of tremendous depth, hot springs have no<br>constrictions, so water rises, cools and sinks freely. </p>
<p>Old Faithful is more<br>than its namesake world famous geyser (top photo), you can view hundreds of<br>other geysers and hot springs.</p>
<p>You have the rare<br>opportunity to view animals who are wild, they behave like their ancient<br>ancestors, as you know if the traffic in the park, only reason is the animals<br>are tired and lying on the road maybe for a day or more, to be human being we<br>have to say nothing and wait, due to this is their areas. Enjoy watching<br>animals but stay safe, they are wild and dangerous really.</p>
<p>Every corner of<br>Yellowstone reveals the park’s rich array of nature and history.</p>

This trip for living we were almost one night only and then move to next<br>stop, we have to follow our schedule.</p>
<p>After whole day visiting the west of Yellow Stone<br>Park, it was dark outside and late, everybody was tied especially our dear<br>Xiang Hui he drove all day long without close his eyes for the seconds, As our<br>plan tonight we will stay the last night there, when we checked in the hotel, a<br>girl she was the receptionist told us the forecast tomorrow will have a heavy<br>snow, she suggested we’d better get out of here tonight, otherwise the road<br>will be closed, maybe one day or more. That mean we had to drive other 100 km<br>away to get out of the park, we checked the internet to confirm the weather it<br>was again, no doubt, and finally we decided we go immediately.</p>
<p>I should thank the girl to tell us the information<br>of the weather; unfortunately I did not take the photo for her, but still<br>remember her kindly smiling face. It was true the next early morning outside, the<br>large snowflakes were falling to cover every corner, to be the silver world and<br>like a fairy tale world. I forgot where I was, just enjoy the beautiful view, taking<br>the photos in different poses, the boys were busy with snow removing from the<br>car to make sure safe for driving, that’s different for girl and boy.</p>
<p>The hotel breakfast was not bad, the cold milk,<br>juices, fruits, I like waffle very much, which was making by yourself, only it<br>was warm and not too sweet at all, everything we were used to have it, before<br>we left there we took the bottle coffee away for each of us on the car as<br>native people.</p>
<p>Enjoying the view from the window is wonderful,<br>after seeing heavy snow for the small town and following there were many big<br>white clouds hanging on the blue sky, unbelievable pictures we had, I was totally<br>moved again.</p>

One of emails comes from our American company made me shocked, it said that one expert will come to China supporting our new project at the end of this month. Of course, we plan to ask help from them before the spring festival and we suggest another expert who can really help us for this project. What&apos;s more, we are already contacted the expert in advance to make sure he is available at that time. But, the expert may visit our company that is not really what we expected one based on this email. I didn&apos;t know what happened during the past weeks, the ridiculous thing is the expert who is planning to visit our company at the end of this month and even asked booking lodging for him in advance. Nothing has decided, why was he so hurry? We even did not send the invitation letter to him, how can he have confidence to make sure we are happy about his support? To be honest, his presence means nothing, because we all know that he doesn&apos;t specialize in the field that we are really eager for support.     As a return, I immediately forward this email to related guys in company and try to correct this stupid mistake and push this case can quickly go back on the predetermined track and also what I should do is to pay close attention to this case.Hopefully, everything can go as plan

I don&apos;t know whether other guys have similar feeling, but, I always have the feeling that I only take forty percent energy to deal with real problem with my technical skills, as to the rest of energy I have to learn or deal with all complicated procedures in internal, that means, most of time waste on handle procedures and less time for professional skills improved. I think it is most of guys faced in manufacturing company especially for those whose is working on manufacture engineering. To be honest, due to most of time, we just faced with all kinds of automatic machines and less opportunity communicate with customers directly so that we might be good at technical skills, but might be not good at getting along with customers or even colleagues. That is an actual shortcoming to us, sometimes, we also need to show off our strength in front of our boss especially in every critical moment.    Now, the year of 2018 will pass by soon, we will continue the current trend if we already keep a good performance, we will try to stay positive impression on your boss if you are not getting a decent performance during the past months, because the yearly salary raise will be finished be the end of month so that we have to care about the only chance of salary raise.
