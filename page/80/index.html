The past 11 years have united us together. But today we embrace a moment that demands some reflection. Pressures have screwed up our past. Illness has tampered with our present. But fears should not shake our future. Crisis can’t break who we are. It creates who we are going to become, the smarter, the braver and the very better version of us. Our failures—in school, in work, wherever—are just part of life. From the day we were born to the last minute, it’s the mistakes we’ve made get us into trouble, and it’s the mistakes we’ve learnt from that’s going to get us out. Too many seem to think that inaction can shy away from humiliating failures. Son, being a man is about believing that you can’t possibly be always on the right track, because you aren’t built to be perfect. It’s about making peace with the fact that you’ll get lost, tripped and even hurt time and time again. So what was true then is true now. Don’t waste your time making the worst assumptions. Don’t try to avoid those challenges, difficulties and failures that are in store for you to the exclusion of everything else, contorting your life into a false security. Find the opportunity in difficulties. Find the courage in challenges. Find your way out in failures.仿悯农的打油诗：Each tear that’s shed in presentWill make tomorrow’s smile shineWhat will this suffering bringFrom the ashes a phoenix fly to the sky </p>

What&apos;s more, before the busiest time is coming, there are still tons of tasks pending to deal with. Nowadays, I am already stuck in many tasks that I have any opportunities to go away. Sometimes, I feel I can&apos;t breathe well especially when arguing with our supervisor, at the angry moment, I really want to go away willfully, but I can&apos;t because I need this job for supporting myself before I get another job. Most of time, I am contradiction with our environment, on one hand, I am not happy with something around me, but I must show it&apos;s not what I care. ,On another hand, I have to lower my expectation to meet something even I disgust it.    All of these, just because I need adapt surrounding especially when I have no ability to change something. That means I am not enough stronger and I need become more powerful. Also I am not happy with myself, because something I should do well, in actually, I don&apos;t do well.I am not a freshman in working place even I think I am a little old man comparing with my colleagues, what things I need do or what thing I don&apos;t need do, it&apos;s clear for me now--

<p>我们有一句流传特别广泛的话是这么说的，“三岁看大，七岁看老”。</p>
<p>The critical period is<br>under age 3 for a child’s<br>formation of character and cultivation of ability. It is the kid’s companions and education in this period that<br>mold his or her character. </p>
<p>孩子性格形成和能力培养的关键期就在3岁之前，这个阶段的孩子跟随什么样的人，接受什么样的教育，就将会形成相应的性格。</p>
<p>A strong impression<br>will be made on the children by the speech and deportment of the adults<br>accompanying them day and night.</p>

At the same time, to<br>be Chairman of the company, Tiger wants to develop his business in overseas at<br>the long time ago, just by chance; there is a project in Cambodia introduced by<br>one of friends. So Tiger was going to visit at the last week.</p>
<p>Because of Anita was in there, surely I must be follow<br>Tiger for see her for the time. The project is in Westport of Cambodia. Even this<br>was not my first time to go there, I can not believe only two years later, how<br>big change for a city! The road was so muddy and narrow, I remembered only 200<br>km away between Phnom Penh to Westport, we drove 5 hours by cars. But right now<br>40 minutes by air in between. A few houses on the main street but now there are<br>three five stars hotels and many gamble centres, Chinese logos was everywhere,<br>so don’t worry if you don’t speak English, what I am trying to say is that it<br>is very popular many Chinese to invest in Cambodia, due to Westport is really a<br>beautiful and nature place for travellers, and the good situation of The Belt<br>and Road,  there are many oil need to<br>exploited, China has been signed the contract since March of this year. Other reason<br>Westport will be developed in recent years was this is a deep sea, so the port<br>can be the international port in some day later, that’s why be to talent and clever<br>Chinese people might not be missing chance, Surely Tiger to be No 1 of his<br>company, he has smelled and tasted what the market will be, He is ready to be<br>one of investors. </p>
<p>It was a rewarding trip I must say, we learned a lot how<br>the market like in there, what the people needs in this country, the building is<br>built only a few weeks, the change of this city I can say month by month,<br>meaning is after one month later, You will not recognize the place you come<br>before.</p>

There was only 40 minutes by air from Westport to<br>here, it was very convenience compare with two years ago that taken 5 hours by<br>car.  Anita’s driver picked us up in the<br>airport on time.</p>
<p>Anita was kindly inviting us to live her apartment<br>again, the same as two years ago I came here with my friend Marry Liu, this<br>time it was same I live in one bed with Anita, we can have whisper chatting<br>till midnight, so privacy, It was so weird both were lying at two edge of bed<br>when we slept, surely we are not Lesbian, and otherwise it wouldn’t like that. Haha.<br>The location of her apartment is very good near Mekong River, very nice view at<br>the roof platform, many pictures we took at there, the coffee and tea are all<br>free at the lounge, surely free wi-fi as well, and there is the swimming pool,<br>fitness centre at the first flood.</p>
<p>The safety of street at Cambodia is not good enough at<br>the moment, there are some grabbing bags can be happened at anywhere and any<br>moments in the public, so avoid going out for dinner, Anita took away for her canteen<br>foods for us during the working day, the cashew nut which was making by her<br>staff, there is one machine for baking it only, unbeliever it was so big and<br>still hot when we took it. </p>
<p>This time we came to Cambodia, one of reason was to visit<br>an officer who worked in the local government, to see whether he can introduce some<br>projects or using the relationship to find the opportunities of business. But surprise<br>we were told that don’t pull any relationships with them, it was very corrupt<br>officials here ever worse than our cities in China, if you would invite them to<br>have a dinner together or some events to let them to come, you might has to pay<br>appearance fee first, sounds  ridiculous!<br>Well enough the guy accepted Tiger’s invitation to meet at our apartment for<br>coffee only in the lounge, Surely China Wine to be the gift send to him to show<br>our respect, he was very happy to welcome our coming.</p>
<p>This was another nice trip again to Cambodia, Anita<br>asked for the hug before we left, I knew she will miss me and the same I will<br>miss her not less than her, I will be always waiting her at somewhere in the<br>earth to have our own privacy talking.</p>

I have been there at 20 years ago of red<br>tour with the company, the impression was the mountain as landscape picture with<br>misty rain and cloud.</p>
<p>I was invited<br>by one of my friends to Lushan Mountain at the last week; surely I was so glad<br>that one of my places to visit again after confirmed the time with three couple’s<br>trip. We were so luck that one of friend was the key person in the railway<br>station, that’s why we took there by train with soft sleeper, which was much<br>comfortable than airplane, due to it was good for smokers and more space than<br>by air. </p>
<p>In my imagination<br>before it was taken at least one hour by car from the foot to the top with<br>mountain plate, you had to suffer car sickness. But this time surprise me that<br>it was only taken 10 minutes by cableway, we have to say it is really great of<br>our china with so fast developing at the everywhere. </p>
<p>We were<br>exciting that our hotel was located just at the side of lake named Ru Qin Lake,<br>which is like a instrument, every morning or after dinner we walked around the<br>lake for a while, the scenery in<br>Lushan Mountain scenic area is breathtaking. It is full of sheer peaks and<br>precipices, changeable clouds and fogs, silver springs and flying waterfalls. Three<br>of our ladies would like taking the photos or videos in different poses under<br>the beautiful nature view, we forgot the time totally enjoy the moment. Meilu<br>Villa, the modern villas are quite a sight on Lushan Mountain. Each villa is an<br>individual building complex with unique style and structure; we would like take the walk around there with<br>heavy plants and trees, of course we cannot miss the chance to take the<br>pictures with sense of time.</p>
<p>Lushan<br>Mountain was elected to the “World Heritage List” in 1996. Owing to<br>its congenial climate, it is also a popular summer resort in China. </p>
<p>It was<br>the really great trip this time, for my friends they came here at the last<br>year, and this year still wanted to come again, you can say how good place for<br>summer visit, please share my photos with you all.</p>

<p>Be confident and speak as often as possible to as many people as you<br>possibly can! Do not be shy to make mistakes! The more you practice the better<br>and more confident you will become in your pronunciation and vocabulary.<br>Remember, speaking is a skill like learning a musical instrument or new sport –<br>the only way you can get good is to actually do it!</p>
<p>2.Use<br>technology</p>
<p>A smartphone can be a powerful tool for learning languages. Use it to<br>record yourself speaking then listen back to see how your English sounds to<br>other people. Make the most of all your favourite productivity apps to organise<br>your practice time and make a note of all the new words you learn.</p>
<p>3.Listen</p>
<p>Listen to news bulletins and songs in English to listen to the<br>pronunciation of words. You can also learn new words and expressions this way.<br>The more you listen, the more you learn! Try copying what you hear to practise<br>your pronunciation and learn which words in a sentence are stressed.</p>
<p>4.Read<br>out loud</p>
<p>Read the newspaper or a magazine out to yourself. You could even find a<br>script for your favourite TV show and act it out! This is a great way to<br>practise pronunciation because your only need to concentrate on making sure you<br>English sounds great and don’t need to worry about sentence structure or<br>grammar.</p>
<p>5.Learn<br>a new word every day</p>
<p>Choose a word you would like to work on and use practice it in different<br>sentences. Use the word until you have learnt it and keep using it regularly.</p>
<p>6.Watch<br>films</p>
<p>Watch movies in English and pay attention to new vocabulary and<br>pronunciation. Imitate the actors and have fun with it.</p>
<p>7.Make<br>friends</p>
<p>Make friends with English speakers or others learning to speak English<br>and compare notes. Talk about things that you have learnt and exchange ideas</p>
<p>8.Do<br>interesting activities in English</p>
<p>Take a cooking course in English or join a book club! Anything you enjoy<br>doing, make sure you do it and communicate it in English. Using English to talk<br>about things you enjoy will make practising a positive experience.</p>
<p>9.Have<br>a debate</p>
<p>Debate all the topics that interest you with friends in English. Try to<br>use as much vocabulary as you can to get your point across and listen to the<br>other arguments carefully so you can argue against them effectively.</p>
<p>10.Use<br>a dictionary</p>
<p>Online dictionaries often have audio examples so you can check your<br>pronunciation and there are lots of great dictionary apps that you can take<br>everywhere with you on your smartphone. Make sure not to become too reliant on<br>these tools, though. Have a go at saying the words first then check afterwards<br>to see if you were right!</p>
