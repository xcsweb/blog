The absorbed new knowledge daytime, sucked my energy, dismayed my confidence and at last with the end of the day triggering the brain to rest.

I am surrounded by new knowledge, priorize them and every time dig deeper more compound i find, so i have come to peace.

It looks like a little bit obscurity for the concept of home nowsday. As people went outside to look their fortune, most of us probably stayed much longer time outside than our familiar hometown. That is why we sometimes found it was hard to specify what is the really home in our heart. In my childhood time, I thought grandmother there, it was my home. As i lived and stayed at my grandparents’ home for most of time during the year. Grandmother was getting old as time went by. When I found she was walking crippled and slowly, I could not get known to and  understood that grandmother were old at that time. It was almost ten years since grandmother passed away. The house is still there, but it is surely not called home in heart.  Parents are there, then whatever it could be called home, not matter it is the poorly bungalow or and luxury apartment. Home is the warmest place where you could act naturely, it is a place to soothe your pressure and sadness. Indeed, if there is a home you build in side of your heart, this home would be there to the eternal!</p>

First of all, you have to kiss goodbye<br>to your orderly, highly structure life, I know sometimes life is a bitch, but<br>at least it’s a healthy bitch. So it’s the end of a normal life. </p>
<p>And then<br>just image that you stripped off in front of male doctors for CT scan, and<br>before you got time to put your cloths back on, the next patient, carried by<br>his son, already broke in. Oh yeah, it’s the end of your privacy. </p>
<p>It’s the<br>end of economical lifestyle—not for me yet, but I guess it might be very soon.<br>Many patient pals start to squander the money. It’s like carrying a bomb in<br>your body and you start to realize “I haven’t enjoyed my life yet! There are so<br>many places I wanted to visit but not, so many items I wanted to buy but not. And<br>what’s the use of saving money any way, for my husband’s next wife? “ So, you<br>see. I used to keep a record of every yuan I spent. This habit has been with me<br>for almost 10 years but now I’m thinking about quit. For example, my account<br>today would be: Breakfast: 10 yuan; Railway: 5 yuan; Hospital: 23981<br>yuan—it’s like a bad joke that hurts. </p>
<p>And<br>sometimes it’s also the end of your dignity or wisdom—I am not sure which one<br>it is. It’s been more than two months since I got ill and I’ve been to the<br>hospital like a hundred times, but I still haven’t figure out some procedures,<br>which combines with Are-you-stupid-kind-of-look from the assistant doctors made<br>me start to question my IQ. </p>
<p>For<br>example, how to buy targeted delivery drugs (PS, extremely expensive) is still<br>a mystery for me. The first time, my doctor wrote my prescription, and I went<br>through some procedures. So at the second time, I assumed it’s the same. My doctor<br>was not there, and her assistant refused to write out prescription because they<br>only write it on every Tuesday. It’s already the last day for my treatment, so I<br>had to beg her to prescribe. I pestered her for about half an hour. She finally<br>agreed, but she threw me her signature killing look, as if saying: “Leave me<br>alone, you filthy insect!”. This time, I remembered the Tuesday thing, and<br>because I was on drip that day, so I asked my mum to do it for me.  Half an hour later, my mum came back with<br>tears in her eyes. I was pretty shocked because my mum seldom cried. That lady,<br>or perhaps she was actually the queen of the universe? still refused to write<br>out prescription. Quote: I didn’t know what you are talking about. Can you even<br>speak? （话都说不清楚！）” My mum was 70 years old.  She might not know the name, but whe brought<br>all the paper with her. My mum asked all the doctors she could find, and<br>finally someone told her where to get the prescription. </p>
<p>I<br>thought this time everything would be OK. I am so navie. When I reported my<br>prescription, and I was told that my application is overdue! Nobody told me<br>anything. And I had to find the queen of the universe again. —-here, I really<br>didn’t want to relieve it. </p>
<p>Another<br>patient once said: “Because of this disease, dignity has become something to<br>stamp on.” Perhaps the queen of the universe really hates us, or perhaps she is<br>just overstressed, either way, it’s not worthy of getting angry. Yeah, perhaps<br>it’s not easy. </p>
<p>You<br>know, it could be worse. But as long as it’s not the end of hope, we could<br>handle it. And hope it’s in our heart, nobody except yourself can end it. </p>

It really took some time for the news to sink in. So at first, you would stay calm. You even remembered to call you boss and asked for the sick leave. For quite a long time, you just didn’t realize what had happened. And then I received a call from my colleagues on my way home. They were worried about me, and they wanted to pick me up from the hospital. My voice didn’t quiver when I told them that it was not necessary, I was fine and I’d already headed home. However, when I hang up the phone, tears were all over my face. For the following days, I’ve been trying to brace myself up for it. I know it would be a tough battle, and I need to summon all of my courage, strengths to fight against it. And I hate to put any more stresses on my family. My mum is 70 years old, my husband is on the pills for the depression and anxiety, and my son, my son is faced with enrollment examination of the secondary school. Crying, or break down is simply something that I can’t afford. I can’t bring myself to allow it. So I’ve occupied with every day stuffs, daily reading and learning, pretending that my life is still the same and isn’t that screwed up. It helps. The more you don’t treat yourself as a patient, the less you would feel like one. Today, my final medical test would come out and the doctor would determine my treatment, which means tomorrow, I probably would leave home and stay in the hospital. Everything would not be the same. I shared my learning record on my moments. I’ve held on to it for 856 days without missing a single day. And I probably couldn’t continue it in hospital. After that, I’ve received a bunch of encouraging, comforting words from my friends, colleagues and family. More than one person left the message, texted me and said: “Just call me if you need any help. I’m here.” They brought me into tears. It reminds you of the good side of life. I can’t pretend the hard stuff isn’t hard. I know it’s painful, messy and terrible. But I can handle it. I’ve learned how to approach the pains, the sufferings, and the unknown and I won’t be all alone on this.</p>

I took the pills the doctor prescribed but it didn’t work. I’d thought inflammation was not a big deal, so I decided to push it aside and fully occupied with my son’s school selection battle.  When it’s settled down and I thought it’s the time to deal with my little problem. Three months have already passed.  You see, my husband is extremely sensitive to his health condition. For the past three years, I’ve watched how his overly concerns are worsening pretty much everything. Subconsciously I went into another extreme. Whether overly concerns or totally ignoring is terrible, like the South pole and the North pole, frozen and rigid all over.  On the second time I came to First’s People Hospital, I still got the similar diagnose. Only this time, I was recommended to see a TCM doctor. After giving me a rough body check, the TCM doctor turned very serious. She asked me to do a Puncture test immediately. I should do it the first time because B 超and 造影proves nothing in my condition.  How could I know that? And the mostly important question is : how the doctors in First’s People didn’t know that?  With just a rough body check, the doctors from both Cancel hospital and Huaxi all came to the same conclusion: it could not be Mastitis. The question is, normally you would not choose Cancel Hospital in the first place and as for Huaxi, you need to make an appointment at least a month in advance at their APP—with the help of fast hand speed and pure luck.  After my husband got the news, he was on the phone for a whole night. That’s the way he handled a crisis, conducting every one he could find. And he finally got a very useful information: Huaxi has a green channel for Breast Cancel patient.  Like another patient said, it was almost like winning a jacket pot. All the tests are handled with the first priority in green channel. Otherwise, you might need another half month to wait for a test result coming out.  Want to hear my advice? Take care of yourself and don’t get sick.  </p>

<p>They often greet us<br>warmly “Ni Hao”, when we were walking in street or shopping mall.</p>
<p>However, this is not<br>always the case.</p>
<p>One day, policemen<br>stopped our car while we were passing a crossroad. Our car was driving by our<br>local driver, and I was sure that the driver did not run through the red light,<br>so I thought we would be released rapidly.</p>
<p>After checking the vehicle<br>documents, a policeman told us seriously that the annual inspection of our car<br>was expired. </p>
<p>Through a simple negotiation,<br>we gave him 5000 Djibouti Franc cash and we were released soon with no receipt at<br>all.</p>
<p>Once returning, we<br>planned to proceed immediately to the vehicle’s annual inspection. Finally our<br>vehicle was not inspected either, because the vehicle inspection office found<br>that the annual inspection would be expired in August 2019. No vehicle could be<br>inspected before its expiry date. </p>
