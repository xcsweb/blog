It is<br>not doing something to get something in return.</p>
<p>2.Charity is spending time with an elderly, disabled<br>person or donating blood.</p>
<p>3.Three types of charity are monetary, physical and spiritual.</p>
<p>4.The steps in being charitable are seeing a need,<br>deciding what to give and how to give it, and doing the good deed.</p>
<p>5.The reasons for being charitable are recognizing a<br>problem, caring about the problem, and wanting to do something about it.</p>
<p>The effects of being charitable are helping to relieve<br>the problem, getting personal satisfaction, and working to eliminate the<br>problem.</p>
<p>6.Charity is similar to selfishness, both can be<br>motivated by a desire for recognition, and both can lead to feeling of accomplishment.</p>
<p>7.Charity is different from love, love has a greater<br>degree of personal involvement, is more strongly motivated, and requires more<br>commitment.</p>
<p>Charity is much more than an occasional generous act<br>of giving. Because most people believe that giving is the meaning of the word.<br>Charity needs to be more clearly defined, It is not dropping off a bag of used<br>clothing at a local community centre. It is not buying a drink, one percent of<br>which price will go to the poor area. An important reason for giving charity is<br>not pressure but the personal desire to help others. A charitable person does<br>not seek praise of reward but shows a genuine concern for all people. He or she<br>gives time in addition to material items. Sharing a singing talent by teaching<br>a young child is an example. Signing a form to donate vital organs after death<br>illustrates charity. It is also using occupational skills to help others – for<br>example, a lawyer giving free legal or a doctor free medical advice. So charity<br>is caring enough about others to regularly share one’s assets – both monetary<br>and intangible.</p>

In fact, Chinese restaurants were spread in all corners of the world. So it is without a doubt for Chinese food to be delicious and delectable. While exporting Chinese delicacies, Chinese people are exporting Chinese food culture.Nowadays, The whole world is merging with each other,  Chinese food are popular around the world. However, Western food in China is not popular. Some people, especially young people, although they admire who or what they see the in the scenes of cafeterias in movies or TV, but they still prefer selected Chinese restaurants to eat. I made a little mistake in this way. Five years ago, I wanted to treat some old friends on Christmas eve, and made a reservation at a cafeteria. But at the last, all of my friends agreed to gather around a big round table. They ordered the waiter to put all kinds of cafeteria food on the table, then they started to glut themselves with delicacies. I could only sigh. I think this is a kind of conflict of culture.Personally, I like cafeteria food. It is mainly based on three reasons. First, it’s a healthy way of diet. It wouldn’t produce cross infection. Second, it’s an economic way of diet, by the amount of what you could have or controlled intake of food. It wouldn’t produce waster. The last, this is a graceful way of dieting. It made the traditional complexed diet process into a simple course. Of course, it is not fit for those people who hopes to solve some problems through banquet.Corrected by Teacher Chawee</p>

Everything becomes dull. It is good for staying at bed for doing nothing. Even though today is sunday. we have to work as last friday we had worked off. So sunday instead has to work.  Time is passing so quick, Incredibly, Life sucks again at this moment. Age increases, not achievement which make me sad.  Most of time I felt  nervous as job and financial problem. That is probablly whyi I continue this job. I do not have courage to quit at this moment.  If without pursuing, Life would be nothing, which I clearly know about that. But suviving  is important to. I have to balance the pros and cons when i decide to change the job or not. Indeed, changing a job is inevitable as my present job is nothing related with language. I am afraid of losing my language skills.  Except for the job, I hope my mother can be recovered from the mental problem which bothered her for years.  These few weeks I have a serious problem for the sleeping too. I experienced waking up at the midnight and then I will awake till the morning. Terrible, I hope I can have a good quality of sleeping. For the above problem, I think I may use mobile phone  too long hours per day. Instead I do not read book. Some people are losing the capability for reading one book. I found I was the one too. So sad. reading is always giving us the nurture, which broaden our vision.  Hopefully I can adjust myself and alert the crisis of myself. Like a frog staying in the heating wather, I am afraid that I will die like that.    </p>

As plan I met him at the entrance around 10am this morning. As<br>I knew he likes audio system, collection, Jade ware and coffee etc, that’s why<br>I like following him to go there, to learn some knowledge of coffee and support<br>my blog as well.</p>
<p>He was late because of the traffic, I was waiting there<br>for a half hour, just taking some photos in front of entrance, this was my<br>first time to see coffee show, even I bought some coffee bean and coffee powder<br>when I was travelling to some countries, but I did not know how to make the<br>coffee with the machine, how to foaming milk and tasting many kind of coffees, I<br>guess I cannot get to the sleep well tonight.</p>
<p>There was so attractive for a 3D printing on the milk,<br>you can select the picture as you like in the system, I asked printing a piece<br>of flower on the top of milk, just one second, like a stamp, a beautiful rose<br>was printed. As I knew before Vanilla powder is good for a coffee if it was a<br>little bitter for normal people, but today I realized the syrup in different favours<br>is good for coffee right now, it is under 100 yuan for one litter bottle, it is<br>not expensive I must say, it was cheaper than Jing Dong and shopping mall as well.</p>
<p>There were many Italian coffee beans and powder, Lavazza,<br>Versilia. Toschi which is a brand of syrup is popular right now. In fact I know<br>nothing about coffee before. Mr. Meng introduce me some friends there, some of<br>them are the mangers of counter and some of them are the agency of coffee. If you<br>want to open a coffee shop with one of brands coffee, they would provide the<br>machine and training for the staff, and also give you the proposal how to running<br>a shop, and I was told they are only renting the machine for their profits. So if<br>you want to invest your spare money, you should think about it.</p>
<p>Very a sense of fulfilment half day I had, I should<br>thank my friend Mr. Meng bring me to this industry, I came back with fruitful<br>results, not only for some of packages coffee I bought, but also I have learn a<br>lots of coffee and I have known some friends as well. </p>
