So huge<br>pressure in front of us, I can’t imagine how to complete it.

There are lots of factors caused the delivery time<br>behind of schedule and they also have some unpredictable factors waiting for us.<br>Anyway, it’s a big challenge for me to handle this kind of project. I just hope<br>everything can keep in order. </p>
<p>For this project, there are three so called expert<br>already on site for supporting in order to run the process smooth. I admit they<br>can help us in theories, but, I don’t think they can help us doing detailed<br>tasks such as program create or debut even the basic machine setup. But,<br>anyway, even they are invited to come here, they must have their strongpoint in<br>somewhere. As plan, they will be stayed here for at least two week, I don’t think<br>I have too much time accompany with them, because there are always tasks<br>waiting me or our team to handle……</p>

But it is now used by some people to describe a happy life.  Why does the posture of “facing the sea” connected with the “happy life”? Personally, I think having a  happy life is set up on the basement of the material. Where the economy is developed, where trade is prosperous, where the material life is rich and colorful, the people living there have a high quality of life and therefore have a happy life.China’s reform and opening originated from coastal areas. Shenzhen and Zhuhai are the first set up in 80 last century two special economic zones. The special economic zone practice special economic policy, Mainly through reducing or exempting customs duty and offering excellent environment of investment for introducing foreign investment. At the same time, input advance technology and ways of managing and reaching our purpose to improve the special economic zone’s development.The coastal areas are facing to the sea and owns a lot of commercial advantages. Under the guidance of Shenzhen and Zhuhai, a number of national-level economic development zones, such as Shantou and Xiamen, have been established successively. These cities became the front cities of reform and opening of China. At the same time, the people there  are enjoying the high interests from advantages of trading policy. They have become the first rich people. Everyone shines with happiness. The city has become a new one.  There are many skyscrapers everywhere and the birds sing and dance, flowers blooming. Everywhere is warm and peaceful. So”facing the sea with spring blossoms” is a truth described as the situation of the people who are living in coastal areas. However, in most of China’s poor areas, especially in the central and Western regions, people’s lives are not rich. Some people are still living in difficulties. Some children in mountainous areas still can’t go to school, and even some people and children are still hungry. Obviously, there is a huge gap between the poor and the rich. We can’t help asking what caused all this. There are various answers. Personally, I think, the main reason is these areas are not “facing the sea”. These areas I am talking about here are not “facing the sea”, not literally. Actually, I mean, these areas don’t have preferential policies from the government. The government hopes that developed areas will promote the development of poor areas. But China is so big that the development of each region is unbalanced. Therefore, people living in poverty-stricken areas look forward to some special policies to help them get rid of poverty and move towards common prosperity.I hope that one day, all the Chinese people will be able to “face the sea” together to create a happier life.Corrected by Teacher Chawee</p>

The only difference was that she hasn’t hold phone in her hands.  She did nothing except lying there with a helpless expression.  It was something like puzzlement or agony or both. “What’s wrong with you? If you don’t want to make supper, we can dine out.” “Alan passed away.” she articulated the three words.  “What?” “Unbelievable !” I almost screamed at the surprising news. Just ten days ago, Alan still lived in my home, dreaming to find  a handsome job and making a new living in Beijing in the future with her son. As far as I can remember, my wife only has three best friends of whom she has been the first. Alan was brought up in a small town in north China, she was always proud, sensitive, independent and lone. However, life seemed to be a joke for her. In the family, she was not the apple of her parents’ eye for their more attention to their son.  As such, she was no longer attractive for her husband who ever spent a long time in working elsewhere, where they drifted apart in the long separation. Moreover, she became a layoff from a local SOE long ago, and had to worked in a private company with scanty salary and support her son, a freshman in a famous university. Facing the miserable life, she finally determined to make a living in Beijing, and turned a new page in her life in the middle age. Babysitter is a reachable and lucrative job in her mind. In the consecutive two months, she worked as a babysitter in four families, taking caring of baby or and adult around the clock. For several times, she texted to my wife, complaining the naughty baby and lazy parents, but she never intended to give it up because it was the only window to enter the new life and world. Till last month, she was luckily hired by a rich family with a less burdensome job. As she made up her mind to devoted to the job, she was seized by miocardial infarction when she rise up in early morning, and died on the way to hospital. Almost all her friends labeled her life as sad story.  As a middle-aged woman’s life is composed of low-paid job, irresponsible husband, indifferent parents and depended son, which is doomed to fall into an abyss or marsh. All along, the overwhelming pride spur her to struggle and endeavor to strive in the curse, but ended in failure.  Putting ourselves into her shoes, how can we do, how far we go and how long we can endure? </p>

Anyway, it is a little bit cool in the morning and evening, and warmer in the day. Some fallen leaves gradually scatter on the ground. The red and yellow leaves decorate streets and later are collected by garbage workers. According to the weather forecast, it has the temperature reduced. Obviously, it is cooler than what it was days before. From the noon it started to drizzle. Then more leaves will sporadically land down and demonstrate the beautiful scenery.

It just skidded away without making a sound, without me aware of it. But it doesn’t mean it’s not an important year for me. Actually 2018 has been a crucial year. I also did a lot of thinking in 2018, about my work, my bitter marriage, and my future. In terms of my work, I finally officially re-joined the team in 2018. God I tried so hard to come back. Not that I loved it so much that I had to come back. It’s just the feeling that I didn’t belong to anywhere else. Well, all coins have two sides. The good side of this is that I got my career back on track, and the bad side of it is that the workload doubled, or even tripled, somehow. A full year has nearly gone. The last official working day was 29 December. Even on that day I was still trying my best to cope with the situation I was in. This is something that I never expected could happen. Well, face the fact. All I can do is to work harder and with a sincerer heart next year. Hopefully things will change a little bit next year. I hope I can feel better. In terms of love, well, I feel like I’ve lost all the strength to love. my heart now is like a lake with all its water drained up, the only thing left is a bare lake bed. I divorced my husband in mid-2017, and 2018 has been a year of rehabilitation. I hoped I could pick myself up and started to love again. I had a few one-off dates, but they never worked out. Maybe they weren’t the right one, or maybe I was the problem. I don’t know. What I do know is that I’m not exactly longing for another love story for now. I’ve kind of lost trust in all men. I’m so sure there are good men out there. I just need time and luck. I don’t extravagantly hope that I meet my Mr. Right in 2019. But I’ll try to be a better self, I need to make sure if he’s really there, I’m ready. 你若微笑，清风自来。In terms of my future. With my marriage dead, I can’t give myself a reason why I am still here in Shanghai. Even my big boss is curious why I stick to Shanghai all by myself. I think in early 2019, I will work out a solution as to where I’ll end up at. Shanghai is a nice city, but I feel that we don’t belong to each other. I’m just a passer-by, for the most part. Therefore, I think I will try to find a job back in my hometown so that I can stay with my parents who are growing very old. Maybe in my hometown, I can start to love again. Well, this is it. My dear 2018, thank you for being there with me. No matter how much I want you to stay, now it’s your time to go. </p>
<p>2019, I welcome you with all my heart. It won’t be a easy year, but I’ll try my best to be strong, be peaceful, smile all the time. You wait and see!</p>

<p>For a long time, I just stared at this<br>message and didn’t know how to react. I need to sort my thoughts out, but how? </p>
<p>I keep falling, and there is no bottom of<br>life. The abyss seems to stretch like forever. </p>
<p>Seven months. Three hospitals, tried all<br>the treatments available and visited countless doctors. No one could give us an<br>explanation. Perhaps there is one but it is not enough to pull me out of<br>suspicions and doubts, which has already torn me apart. </p>
<p>The last visit to the doctor happened about<br>two days ago. </p>
<p>It took me about a whole month to make that<br>appointment and two hours to wait outside. And ten minutes later, we were literally<br>thrown out of the door. </p>
<p>The doctor had a blister tongue, and every<br>word he said seemed to be a slap on the face. </p>
<p>“You are wasting my time. Yes, you have a<br>slipped disc. Yes, it pains. So what? Accept it. Mine is worse than you and I still<br>have a job to do, and a life to live. Okay, I’m telling you this just for the<br>sake of your wife. You are lucky because she is still there. Accept the pains, be<br>a man and get a job!”  </p>
<p>The question is my husband can’t stand it.<br>Perhaps he is just extremely sensitive to the pains, or perhaps long time of<br>lying in bed has finally broke him, eroded his courage, and makes him sort-of<br>addictive to the bed, or perhaps it’s just a matter of time, or perhaps all the<br>doctors have made a huge mistake and his condition is much worsen—-I just don’t<br>know! And all these Perhaps are going to kill me. </p>
<p>I need a break. I start to avoid his company.<br>I don’t know how to face him. There is something burning in my chest<br>threatening to well up. I have to use every ounce of my strength to keep it in<br>check. </p>
<p>“I’m not imaging these pains!” he keeps<br>saying that. And when I was in line to get his medicine, he wanted to come back<br>to the car to lie down, to rest. I exploded: “Then prove him wrong! If I were you,<br>I would bite the bullet to get out of that damn bed. Even it was going to kill<br>me, at least I was telling the world I am not that weak!”—perhaps I was not<br>fair to say that. Just as he said, I didn’t have a slipped disc and I didn’t<br>know what he was going through. </p>
<p>Could it be worse than give a birth? </p>
<p>For the last two days, fairly speaking, he did<br>try his best. He made a record to leave the bed for three to four hours a day,<br>which was already double as the usual. </p>
<p>The pains, the sufferings. And today, on<br>the way to the nearby bread shop, he collapsed. He made it 40 minutes. </p>
<p>What should we do?</p>
<p>Keep trying. Fight. </p>

Yes I am not a scheming woman, very simple and fully trust on<br>Tiger whatever he did in my life on money management. After buying the office<br>which is quite big issue in this year, Room rental in quarterly is quite big<br>amount to be flowing deposit on my account, so I have to think about how to<br>manage the money regularly. </p>
<p>There is a MinShen Bank in our community; the service<br>in this bank is different with other banks I have seen before, no counter, just<br>like a home, to treat the people as one would treat your family, two staff like<br>your assistant, whatever you asked they always give your answers beyond your<br>expectation. they are wearing the uniform which is more elegant , not only give<br>you’re the idea how to manage your money efficiency and also to tell how to use<br>Bank App freely in details instead of lining up in the other bank for doing<br>some pennies.</p>
<p>I was told every Friday morning at 9 am, the financing<br>products will be released on time by the central bank, one of staff would like<br>told me the information one day early in wechat, let me have the good<br>preparation to catch up the product, for instance, what’s the name, the interest<br>and the period of product, all the information has to know before purchase,<br>other wise you will be late and out of sell in one or two minutes.</p>
<p>The last week I was waiting to buy the one product before<br>five minutes early on my cell phone, unfortunately, I was missing the chance<br>just one or two minutes, due to I did not know the purchasing in 10 thousands<br>accumulate only, after I corrected the amount and retyping the word, there was<br>no balance left for it just in one minute. The staff was encourage me and let<br>me put the money into the temporary account first till the next week coming. </p>
<p>This week I have learned the lesson I was ready to<br>purchase again before the product releasing. The time I was doing smoothly and I<br>made it. Very interesting for playing the money like game, I learned how to manage<br>my money and I will continently play my money in the future. </p>
