The breeze brings the fresh air flipping your round and seems to slow down your pace towards the world.   I am not sure from when that i appreciate this kind of time slow suspension, take my time not hurried to act on sth, the view deeper in the eye and softness laying inside.    Street dancing, the turn-up volumn, slow-paced lyrics showcasing the agreeableness of the people in their 40-60. Their leisured life style swaying with the surroudings to form the unique corner which had your mind suspended and tranquiled. That piece of freedom is i envy, but the reality is unaffordable to tamed me.    Just like you walk into a film clip in which you downplay everything on purpose and empty wants, all is that let it be, that kind of lightness like a flying feather staggering into all possibility and the end landing on the ground is inevitable. I wish that period could be prolonged and prolonged, the languid body, faint mind destined rest there.    At last, it ends like the world, time never suspended, it is just pure over.</p>

In fact, I went so far that it had become kind of obsession. Once I laid my eyes on one of those beautiful, fabulous notebooks, I just could tear my eyes off it until it had become mine.  Everything was great, except that one teen tiny little thing: My handwriting is terrible, which means, most of my collections are too good to make notes on so they were just lying silently in my desk.Then one day I suddenly realized that was wrong. Notebooks are supposed to be written things on. They have their own destiny to follow, their own responsibilities to take. So, I gave up this habit for good.  However, there is a little girl living inside my heart, who is still drooling over those beautiful notebooks and wants desperately to make a beautiful notebook of her own, no, not just the regular ones, but one of those journals, the kind as smart as a fashion magazine.  They say that embrace your inner wire, whatever that may be. So, finally I decide to follow this foible of mine down to those rabbit holes.Now Pandora’s box is open. It is true that moment you jumped into the pit of journal, you can kiss goodbye to your pocket.Before I even started to make one journal, I found myself already in the craze of shopping. And this time it’s not just notebook, but seals, stickers, washtapes, gel pens all wink at me sending the same message: “Buy me, I’m cute.”Oh, God, I’m doomed.</p>

As<br>everyone knows, machine learning(ML) is widely used in a variety of business application<br>solutions in the age of AI. How to test a service based on ML</p>
<p>is<br>becoming a problem we have to cope with. Since traditional test method strictly<br>depends on the Oracle problem, it is totally useless in the AI period.</p>
<p>In<br>software testing, an oracle refers to a mechanism which can tell you whether<br>the output of one case running is correct or not. For those services or application<br>based on algorithm or ML models, it is impossible to find such an oracle to<br>assert the result, so we have to introduce new test method such as metamorphic<br>testing for them.</p>
<p>The<br>basic concept of metamorphic testing is that even though we cannot check the<br>output of one input we can define the relation of two outputs of twos relative inputs.<br>For example, when testing sin(x), we don’t know the exact result of sin(11), we<br>know sin(12) is greater than sin(11), because the sin function is incremental<br>between 0 and 90. That is the metamorphic relation is sin(x+1)&gt;sin(x).<br>Another merits of the test method is that it can be automated totally, which allow<br>tester to check nearly all the inputs in the input fields.</p>
<p>In<br>sum, metamorphic testing will must become prevalent in the age of AI. I believe<br>it. </p>
