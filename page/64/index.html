<p>Dear Mr. Smith,</p>
<p>How are you now?<br>I’m writing to express my sincere thanks to you for your big help in the<br>improvement of my oral English.</p>
<p>Two months ago,<br>I came to the training center with great hope and admiration. I still remember<br>my oral English then was so poor that nobody could understand my self-introduction,<br>which was really a great blow to me. In the following courses that day, I did<br>not even open my mouth. However, after class you told me that nobody would<br>laugh at me, what I need to do was to speak, and speak loudly. Under your<br>encouragement and guidance, I began to speak in the class gradually and<br>corrected my pronunciation consciously. Two months pass quickly and now I can<br>talk with English-speakers fluently and naturally. All these are due to your<br>kind help and excellent teaching, so thank you!</p>
<p>Now I am back in<br>my own country, and I will begin my work tomorrow. However, no matter how busy<br>I will be, I will insist on practicing my oral English. So believe that, next<br>time you see me, you will find that I speak English so well just like a native<br>speaker.</p>
<p>Best wishes to<br>you.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Jack Peng</p>

<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
<p>I’m writing this letter to express my<br>dissatisfaction with the terrible situation I have faced lately. I’m a resident<br>on Donghu Street.<br>I have been living there for more than ten years and enjoy my life all the<br>time. However, some unhappy things happened recently and have bad influence on<br>my life.</p>
<p>Near my house, a few restaurants have been<br>founded in the past few months. These restaurants offer food to the residents<br>nearby, but meanwhile yield a large amount of rubbish, which seriously pollutes<br>the living environment of ours residential districts. </p>
<p>I understand that these people need to find<br>some way to make a living, but they should not damage the interests of other<br>people. Therefore, I hope the relevant government departments would send<br>someone to discuss some solutions with those people, clean up the rubbish, and<br>return a clean, pleasant and healthy environment to us.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>Yours<br>sincerely,</p>
<p>Jack<br>Peng</p>

Nobody could give us a confirmative<br>answer. “It’s all up to you.” The doctor said. However, do we really have any other<br>options? </p>
<p>In the past six month, we visited 6<br>hospitals, consulted about a dozen of doctors and tried almost all the<br>treatments except the surgery—which most of the doctors don’t suggest, but now<br>it seems to be the last straw for us to clutch at. </p>
<p>For God sake, having a slipped disc (锥尖盘突出) doesn’t<br>necessarily mean you have some serious, deadly disease. However, nobody could<br>give us an explanation why he still couldn’t walk, sit longer than 20 minutes. If<br>there was any sign of recovery, we would not make this decision. However, he<br>has stayed where he is for several months, even when all his MRI, CT tests<br>suggest quite the opposite. </p>
<p>Pressures keep mounting up. I can’t help<br>but wonder: would it be different if he tried harder? That doubts almost eat me<br>alive. Just a couple of days ago, I was diagnosed as nephritis and the doctor suggested<br>15-day intravenous infusion. I made it 5 days—the longest time allowed for me<br>to be sick. There was a fire in my heart. I want to prove that if you got<br>spirit, you won’t be defeated by disease and you could make a miracle. That’s<br>why I got off the bed even when I was running a fever at 39 degree Celsius and<br>why I forced myself to finish my study when my temperature was as high as 40 degrees.<br>It’s stupid, and I know it. </p>
<p>It is like a<br>vicious circle, every time hope raises up with each treatment, but only more<br>disappointments and pains follows. I dare not to think about the future now.<br>What would happen next? What the fate has stored in for us? </p>

In my eyes, life just like a cup of pure water, you can touch it, feel it ,taste it , but it just keep the way as it should be—always keep the same way: no colorful, no variety flavors, no feelings. I like the word :” When the God offer you a cup of water, then you get your life from drinking it.”Life just like water, it has no special meanings. What so called “poor or rich” , “honor or humble” are nothing but condiments which we add to life according our attitude and ability. Some people like colorful and exciting life, they just stir life into multi flavor sauce; Some people enjoy themselves despite poverty, they stir life into coffee;  Some like add honey into life, change it into sugar water; Some make life into tea, they like tasting the life little by little;  Some don’t know what to add into life, they just leave the life alone, and add nothing; And some people change their life into poison without knowing , and buried their life by themselves.Some people lead an aimless life, they don’t know what they really need or want, then they just follow anyone like a sheep,  at last,  they gain nothing but misery. In my opinion, if a person set up a goal, learn to grasp chance, learn content and be grateful to anything, then he or she is not far away from happiness. Life is just like a pure water, it need us to taste , to appreciate , to change it with our heart, then we may create our great life through that very water.搜索复制</p>

It’s a X-men kind of story, one of my favorites. It starts with<br>a high school girl living in a small town, who has a very special talent: she<br>can draw the picture of the future. Personally, I think it’s a pretty cool<br>power but obviously her class mates, teachers and neighbors don’t think so. She<br>became an outcast, she was called as witch and no one would invite her to any<br>social event. Then one day a woman showed up and brought her to a lab where<br>there are several other special kids, all with this or that superpower. I didn’t<br>have text of this book, so if I want to know about this story, there’s only one<br>option: listening to the audios. If I stay focused, I could get the most part<br>of the story. The problem is when I am listening, my mind is so easy to wander<br>around. So I have to listen to it again and again.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, we are losing our<br>listening, and here I’m not just talking about English learning. Study shows<br>that we spend roughly 60 percent of our communication time listening, but we<br>retain just 25 percent of what we hear. </p>
<p>And every day, there is someone in this<br>world committing suicide because of depression, and almost all of them sent their<br>cry for help before they made that fatal decision, however, no one truly and<br>really listened, no one received their messages for help. </p>
<p>When it comes to communication skills, many<br>of us have already heard advice like look, nod, and smile to show that you’re<br>paying attention during the conversation. That’s crap because if you really are<br>paying attention, you are paying attention and you don’t need to show it. If<br>you try to pretend that you are paying attention, you really think that people<br>would not know it?</p>
<p>Listening might be the single most<br>overlooked skill we fail to cultivate. And do you know how much you can possibly<br>earn by simply listening carefully? I can give you a rough answer: probably 400<br>yuan per hour. </p>
<p>Seriously, that’s what I paid an online<br>psychologist, for listening to my headaches with an understanding ear, without judges<br>and prejudices. Sounds quite simple, doesn’t it? But I assure you many of us<br>can’t do that. </p>

The sudden and unpredictable change of weather really makes you no choice of the what the next step you could move. While in another way, it is the beauty of life to have this chance to view the picture of sunshine, rain, wind in a short time. It polishes your heart and trains your mind. Meanwhile it hardens your will to face everything in the trending of changing. Otherwise, you can hardly live peacefully because you are likely to be mad due to the constant weather changing. It is getting warmer. Trees and flowers are seizing the ideal moment to grow up. Cute buds of trees and flowers are telling people about the arrival of spring. Girls make fully of this time to have their colorful clothes in this wonderful season. They never miss this kind of a chance. That curvaceous figure naturally impresses you a lot at the noticeable moment. Usually after a night of rainfall, petals scatter to the land. Opening the window, you see them there as if they were saying MORNINIG to you. If you say hello to them you have the feedback of their honesty and innocence.
