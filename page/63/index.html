On departure, 4-year-old daughter asked why father<br>had not come. Wife explained that father was busy, and so was mother, “Mom and<br>dad will not be able to be with you the coming weekend.” To appease her discontent, wife promised that the absconded father would talk with her over the phone that evening. Hearing this<br>she took a little bit heart. In the late afternoon before joining in a dinner party<br>with her former comrades-in-arms, she reminded me again not to forget to give<br>daughter a call. And this I did at 6:30pm. The line was connected. Supper just<br>over, she was now absorbed in a TV cartoon. Eyes glued to the screen, she responded casually to me, totally leaving behind what had happened in the morning.</p>

We are busy doing for living while rarely squeezing the time to think about what we really want to have. We are occupied to be slaves, losing self awareness and becoming zombies. We are not brave anymore, instead, we are submissive. Does this kind of style suit for us? Is there another way to get through this staganation?A voice in the heart tells you that it must change. “Right, step out, you can,” the voice comes out and activates every cell in the body. Once we realise it is at the corssing, we should go and make a change by choosing a direction. Why do we hesitate going any further? Because we do not know where is the best way to solve problems. Actually, there is no choice for such a way. It does not exist. We only talk about stories of successful guys and do not think it too much about what they really have experienced. What we do is gong to be history which is to be the study for later generations. We are the pioneer of future, paving the way for recording a better tomrrow.What can we do is to go ahead. This way is full of uncertainties and hardship. It still has the magic for trying. We never stopping exploring which is the power to drive us moving further. There is no need to fear and we are supposed to accept the challenge to overcome timidness.</p>

If you want to lose weight, you have to keep diet and do more exercises. Certain sacrifice has to be made. You can neither eat too much nor enjoy yummy food. Something has to be done.When it comes to life, we really have to be serious. The single journey does not come back again, only can we do is to drive the way positively.

Especially, when I talked with customer face to face, it still is a challenge for me to hear every word from customer so that I felt a little awkward when I can&apos;t totally understand what they said. Currently, I think I can express my though with simple words by email, but, I still have a problem with speaking and listening especially it comes to listening. It&apos;s my painful at current stage that it needs to improve in the following step and I hope I can do better and better. As the leader of the new project, I encounter another problem that I need to spend more energy for communication with others and coordinate the relationship between them, what&apos;s more, some guys are not always easy to get along with even they don&apos;t care about the project in a way. I think the communication skill is also my shortcoming than others.    Anyway, at the end of this year, I have no room back on this case, I told myself I have to stick to this way and try to keep on going.

</code></pre><p>on the way, as usual, we will do summary and sum up all we did in life and work<br>during the past year. No doubt, there was always something we did that is not<br>satisfied even by myself, because I do not insist on keeping on going so that<br>it did not reach what I expected at the beginning of this year, anyway, I still<br>need to keep forward no matter how far is the target. Now, what I need do is to<br>set up a feasible and reasonable target that I realize with a little difficulty.<br>I understand the target setting is easy and the hard thing is to follow up your<br>target continuously. I think I at least have ten years golden time in my career<br>if there is no big economic crisis within this period. Of course, this is based<br>on current assumptions. Nowadays, I still think I have room to improve myself<br>and get a higher lever in company, but, I have to admit that I am not an<br>ambitious guy in company even I have the feeling of disgust to these guys who take<br>every opportunity to show off in front of big boss. Absolutely, it will leave a<br>positive impression to big boss, but, I also believe the real status depends on<br>what you contribute to company.    Anyway,<br>everyone has their principles of survival in company. I just follow up my<br>principle and keep my bottom line to everything which happen around me and always<br>to keep calm to handle conflicts during daily work.  </p>

The snow stopped this morning and soon it melted out and the air is quite clean and cold. As always we smoothly say goodbye to the past and the new year comes in silence.This year, the domestic stock market is down by 25 precent. Many intvestors have suffered the loss. It does not stop, it may come back or coninute to fall down for a while. Anyway it will defintely go up. Though we do not know when the turning point it is, as ups and downs normally is the curve happens at any time we have to believe things are going to be okay.This year, we have met and experienced something. Something we did not expect, some other things we have already pictured. All those things are the best tutor to guide us to be more sensible. Not a thing could be independently occurring. Everything tiny litte thing goes to be part of life.When we look backward, everything vividly comes out in mind. This kind of treasure we have to store in the memory that one day it would be another story to recall. Everyone appears in life is someone that we can learn from him/her. Meanwhile, the journey just starts out at another beginning.Hello, 2019.</p>

Particularly before the National Day, there are fewer tourists. The weather is good enough.Being bothered by petty things and pressure from both life and work, sometimes it is a must to squeeze some time to relax. That is the moment which beongs to yourself. Happiness does not only mean a man makes a fortune, in fact, the good feeling comes from content for the current life style. If a guy who is busy day in and day out, in a style of 24/7. Will he feel the sense of quality of life?With nature, its peace calms you down. If we got time, it is needed to visit somewhere. Whether it is a long journey or not, you will relax and feel comfortable during the trip. You may take photoes or have a selfie. You can also have the time to be alone. In a teahouse, having a cup of tea, you are in the tranquility. If possibe, then you even can read a book for a while. Or a talk with good friends would be casually enjoyable.To be honest, I’d rather like being alone on the trip. I do like that moment with myself. Nobody can let me feel bad. In the office, we are with colleagues and bosses, mostly tired up with them in the mingling. That would be the chance to free up. We are already working hard, it is necessary to to be good with ourselves. Life for everyone, is gifted for once. During the life journey, we suffer from the diseases, disasters, meets and parts with important people. It surely requires we are supposed to learn to enjoy what we have. Even a noon nap is splendid right now.</p>

I was informed this morning that my tutor will meet me that day to talk about a very urgent problem in my research project.    I feel honored to be invited to give such a lecture talk, and I think it is a good opportunity for me to exchange with my colleagues to help them know more about Chinese Culture. Can we decide on another date for it, say, next Friday afternoon?    I hope that I will not bring too much trouble to you, and I apologize for that again.
