I could hardly breathe in a 1000-meter-test. My lungs were almost to explod and I painfully prayed it would end as soon as possible. Last weekend, after covering a 16km-distance jog, I was excited and did not sense tiredness. The potential of human beings is marvellous. I can run longer and shorten the time consumed during a jog.I choose to run since it is not that hard<br>to achieve. Only should I do is to keep steping forward and controlling<br>the pace. Particularly, in a long distance jogging, I freely focus on<br>mediation on the way. Easy, isn’t it? It is no great shakes so long as I<br> hang in there. No more sophisticated skills I am about to master. Just run. But we are likely to fail it if we are not ready to<br>endure the solitude, setback, aches on the running way. While that is<br>the right part which exactly attracts me to go on. After conquering a jog, I succeed ascending to a new stage.Generally, in the opposite, we’d like being doing nothing. And everything seems to come true as long as we want it. How terrible it is. As mortals, we just can not be rewarded by paying nothing. Even though we still try to own it. Poorly, if so we live in a world of imagination.</p>

What&apos;s worse, how averagely percent of raise still not published? If everything goes as plan, it should be published regarding salary raise ratio in last monthly employee communication meeting, if it still isn&apos;t clear in the next meeting, that means the actual situation will more worse than imagination. Even though according to current forecast, we are still profitable at the end of this year. The difference is the profit that will be lower than last year and it is also not big boss expectation. That&apos;s the reason why the big boss starts to cost down at the beginning of this year, currently, we are not sure whether it affects the bonus that should be given in next monthly salary, but, we should prepare to live a hard life in the next few months will be common unless the marketing requirement goes up in the second half of this year. We can&apos;t predict the future trend of developing, but, we are definitely hoping our company can always keep upward trend.    Sometimes, we are not happy company&apos;s culture and fairness, but, at every critical moment, we absolutely stand on the company side, after all, we only share benefits based on company&apos;s prosperity. Anyway, we hope the big boss can bring company going on rising ladder.

According to the current situation, it will be beautiful tomorrow. Many guys probably will visit the West Lake again this evening. Some of them even get up earlier next morning at aroud 3 to 4 am to the lake. Three weeks ago it snowed heavily for the first time this year which already had brought happiness for us. We rarely meet this kind of snow in life. Such a chance won’t be missed again. People will flock into scenic areas to have fun with it. This is the last one in 2018.

But I did not have much mood<br>to enjoy the beautiful sightseeing; no passion to enjoy covered with snow, what<br>I was busy is for Tiger.</p>
<p> After Chinese New Year, Tiger was ready for the<br>hospital, I liked taking a baby with his stuffs at the early morning, It was so<br>complicated for living the hospital I realized this time, we went to see the doctor<br>first to get the notification and then we should go the long queue in the<br>counter for deposit payment, at least 5000 yuan to frozen your credit card<br>expense, after that we would go to the other counter to get the wristband for<br>patient, it likes the permission card for in and out of hospital, at the last<br>before you went to the inpatient ward, you have to buy the meal coupon for<br>three meals a day.</p>
<p> Luckily I am much better than other family members of<br>patient whose are from other province, they looked so stubborn for asking some<br>questions in their totally unfamiliar area, you can see from their face were so<br>upset. So for me everything was getting smoothly for Tiger, I can say Tiger is<br>so luck has me around him.</p>
<p>I caught a long breath after finishing all the<br>procedures about two hours, I was sitting on the chair to have a look throw the<br>window, Snowing was still falling down, yes, it was so beautiful day ,isn’t it?</p>

The full name of AGI is artficial general intelligence.  It’s has a wider range than AI.  Most of AI technology focuse on solving specific problems. On the contray, The AGI is more inteligent which is similiar with the human intelligence. It’s multifunctional and can solve different problems.2. What do you think about the Strong AI or AGI     I don’ t think the strong AI will  make a breakthrough in the near future .  Maybe an artficial intelligence who have a emotional and think like human will never come true.      If the strongest AI come true in the future,  I don’ t  think it’s a good thing for us.  If they are more knowledgable , efficient and intelligence than human beings.  What’s the value of us.  Maybe we’ll extinct.      On the contrary, I think the low AI will bring a huge development in the future.3. What is the creative work., Please take an example.      Maybe AI will have a good performance in database, caculate ant manufacture.  But I don’t think they will surpass human in the ability of emotional , assocation and logical thinking. The work depend on these abilitied can be called creative work. Such as painting , invention,  make a decision without many evidance.4.How about the workers replaced by the AI.      The are a huge development in the past 300 years.  Many works are replaced by machine. But now we all have a work. There will be more new job for us.       We can spend more time take care our family and enjoy ourselves with the help of AI.  We will have more vacation and richer life.       </p>

During the past days, I felt unconformable, not only big pressure around me, but the inequality was growing. Furthermore, big boss lost his faith in our manager&apos;s performance even has the trend of replacing him, I though he certainly felt something a lot. Even our company failed to archive intended target last year and the big boos postponed the plan of paying rise, but, today still has released an announcement of one guy promotion from our department. It may issue a signal to our manager that he is on the edge of danger. As the nature of our manger, he could do nothing but waiting, after all, he has been in here for over ten years, he may never though leaving here one day. Actually, he could be a good friend, but he absolutely is not a good leader. I always though the organization of our company has big problems, because big boss involves detailed decision-making too much so that each manager of departments never has their own opinion but following up his instruction. Nowadays, everyone knows the current situation, but no one could bring this information to big boss. Of course, the big boss has their trusted subordinates, unfortunately, they are never from manufacturing but from finance and purchase department. In his mind, the manufacturing guys are always in the lowest rank in company. Is it so ridiculous?

We can benefit a lot from long-life learning. As the time go by, we have many facilities to help us learning. But problems about how to learn ,especially how to teach our children is really a hard nut to crack. Nowadays learning environment is very different from past. Kids now are very hard to teach, not only because they know more , but also hi-tech provides more games for children. In addition, parents are too busy to teach their child, or they don’t know how to teach their kids.Here are some suggestions about how to teach child:一.     Pre-school PeriodAt this period, we mainly teach kid know all kinds of rules. We help kids to understand some basic ideas about rules, such as sleeping at certain times, work while work, play while play.二.     School PeriodAt this period, there are lots of things to do in order to cultivate a good learning habits for the kids.In Grade one and two, we mainly help our kid cultivate habits. We let them know what they should do at school, and what they should do at home. We help them in reading, writing and using their own words to express what they have remembered.In Grade three to Grade six, we should achieve these goals: Child know how to learn; they are interested in study; they like reading and writing; they can use their own words to express their ideas clearly, and at last, they can balance time between study and play.三.     Some knowledge about spending moneyWe teach them how to use money wisely. We can achieve this goal by asking kids to help us buy some daily necessities, or offer some chances for kids to earn some money at home. Let them know how to spend money worthily.       Anyway, child education is not easy, we have to find many ways to adjust from time to time in order to pave a bright road for their future.

And that culminated when he dragged me to<br>shopping last Sunday. He bought himself T shirts and another two sports pants—this<br>is ridiculous! I mean, I can understand if he bought some formal dress, but sports<br>again, seriously? First, he can’t do sports. Second, he can’t wear that to<br>work. So, is he going to change every a few hours during the weekend—for fun? I<br>tried to be supportive and considerate. I knew that he’s made some money out of<br>the stock market lately, and I knew it was kind of compensatory buying because<br>he hadn’t shopped for quite a long time after he got ill. But still I felt my<br>heart was bleeding. And then against my will, he bought me Nike outfit for<br>running, T-shirt, shorts and shoes, a whole set. It was supposed to cheer me up.<br>Finally, I have something great to wear for running. However, when I tried to<br>ignore the price tag, I failed. So all the time, that figure along with the mantra<br>of minimalism and less is more all swirled together in my mind. And this is not<br>the end. One day later, I received this package and my hand started trembling.<br>He bought me a Huawei P30pro! Oh, my I really didn’t know that to say. Of<br>course, I always wanted a cell phone like P30, with its camera, it’s big<br>screen, and everything. But how could I deal with this burning anxiety and<br>guilty of spending? Unsurprisingly, my eyelid became red and all swollen. If<br>you asked a doctor, he would told you that I had an allergy attack. But I’ve<br>already discovered that  if I was under some<br>mental distress, something physical would go wrong. That’s when I realize that I am in a serious problem. I mean, if<br>shopping isn’t a pains killer but an anxiety trigger instead. What’s fun of<br>that?</p>

<p>Change can be<br>a scary thing. Big changes – for example, having to move or having to find a<br>new job – can mean big stress. Your status quo is interrupted, and you are pushed<br>out of your comfort zone.</p>
<p>There are<br>three basic stages we go through when faced with significant change. The difference<br>is how long you stay at each stage. The first stage is resistance. When you<br>hear about a change, your first thought is that you don’t want to change. There<br>is uncertainty and doubt about the future.</p>
<p>The second<br>stage is going with the flow. In this stage, you go with the change, and do<br>what you have to do to survive. You accept the change, but you aren’t excited<br>about it.</p>
<p>The third<br>stage is openness. This means having an open mind about the possibilities the<br>change might bring. Even if it’s a change you don’t like, you start thinking of<br>your strategy for dealing with it. You accept the change and begin to develop<br>your own plan for the future. The more quickly you can reach stage three, the<br>more quickly you can adjust to a change.</p>
<p>I deeply understand the feeling for three stages of<br>the changes. When I worked in the company, there were many kinds of examples, I<br>changed a new job or transferring to a new department. I had the same feeling<br>to develop my own plan for my career. I have moved my house four times after<br>marriage, before I moved my family, I was really doubt the new place was good<br>or bad, but due to SAS I had to move from crowded to more roomy area. That’s<br>why I like copying the words here to remember expression.</p>

I was impressed by their strong vitality. They live everywhere in any bad circumstance. As long as I see any of them, I try best eradicating it because I do not feel comfortable being with those uninvited guests.Since the rain, it is getting cold and more like winter. In the morning, on the way to the office, I saw leaves falling down, they overlapped and scattered on the ground. Leaves from poon, gingko and all deciduous trees are joining in that exhibition. Sooner or later, they are all gone and we can only see new leaves again next year.This kind of rain may last for several days till this weekend, after that, it will be sunny but cold. These days I choose not jogging around because it is muddy, rainy and windy outdoors. Indoors exercises are just right for this moment.Tomorrow I have to wear the overcoat since it is really becoming cold. According to the weather forecast, it will fall down below 10 degrees, even lower to be 3-4 degrees as  the minimum temperature on this weekend. I have to keep warm otherwise I am likely to catch a cold.</p>
