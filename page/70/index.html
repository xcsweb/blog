Once, I was the best Roller Coaster. I sent many, many people fly into the sky and rush downhill into a twisting drop. With me, the connection between my riders and the world was strengthened in every ride. The adrenaline rush, the thrill, the speed, the sense of danger, when you embraced all of these, the time seemed to be frozen in one specific moment, where with all the screams drowning out by your own heartbeat, you could almost feel the pulse of the universe. Once, I was the kids’ favorite. Thousands upon thousands of kids got rocked, rolled, launched, and twisted in every ride, empowering their young spirits. When they got off with their wobbling feet, they said: “I would never ride it again!” But, they always came back. Until one day, I didn’t remember exactly since when, they just stopped visiting. It is said that somewhere in Chengdu, there is another theme park, with another roller coaster, bigger and shriller. I didn’t believe it. I remembered every little face, when they first came to me, they looked up at me, with awe and expectation. The expression was so intense that it itched into my memory. Of course they would come back to visit their favorite buddy. They didn’t, and I’ve waited, waited for many years. The amusement part was shut down in 2008. Many attractions have been torn down. Part of me has gone too, I am broken and I am nothing but a piece of junk. I could never feel the pulse of the universe; I could never hear the roars of screams and laughters. And I knew, they won’t come back. I stood there watching my riders growing up, witnessing the ground breaking of this city. The years come and go. This year something happened. Before the spring festival, people came to me, and they changed me into a dragon! A beautiful dragon with neon lights. And there was more. They built a LED screen, which lasts more than 100 miles in Jingjiang River, creating a world of light above the water, conjuring the history, the food, the tradition of this city into this magic world. People rushed there to enjoy. A man pointed to me and said to a little boy beside him: “Look, this was the roller coaster, your grandpa brought me here a lot when dad was at your age.” They come back. At that moment, I feel the power of life again. </p>

It is still a way for the training that I have to keep it on regular basis. Summer, it is the nice season to sweat. I can burn a lot fat during the running.On account of the typhoon, it cools and is not that bad. I do not use too much air condition. Usually, I turn it on before going to bed and then I turn it off when I sleep. Using too much air condition does not make me comfortable. The cool air dries the room and my throat is to be bad if I am with the cool air too long.I’d rather like this kind of moment. The Great Heat is halfway and one week later, according to the lunar calendar, the autumn is coming though it is still hot at that time. You will definitely sense that temperature will be different between both in the morning and evening and the daytime.How fast it is. The world cup ended and the French won again after twenty years as of 1998. And the scandal of fake vaccine raised the social anxiety of health and safety. So many things happened everyday. I only hope it get better. What else can I do? What can I do is to change by my hands in the heatwave. </p>

I feel it a must that I have to move. Since I am with power and I do not want to always stay where I am at.Most ones do not like changing because it is hard to break the current situation. They either fear to fail or lack of the confidence to cut off the comfortable zone. As a matter of fact, the worst choice is remaining of nothing changed. Till one day the death arrives, you have no room to hide. What you have then is nothing but the destiny of self destruction. The confidence is not built on words, on the contray, it is the on the base of accumulation of achievements. Whatever you did, wrong or right, they all become the wealth which lonly belongs to yourself. Nobody can steal it, because it is the thing made by you.What if we go into a dead end? Not a big deal. Just try again. There is hope as long as you do not stop and never cave in. One more step, you may find another way to the finishing line.</p>

So the last two weeks they wanted to<br>be there again, they like the local village fair which are only at the 5th<br>or 10th at lunar calendar. Remembered at the last time they bought a<br>lot local dry foods and fresh eggs, the price was so reasonable. The car was<br>full when they were backing home. We checked the calendar again before this outing;<br>Make sure the day with the local village fair day, living one night at my home.<br>Swimming and shopping were the most things as our plan for this outing.</p>
<p>I drove my car to go to Pan Shan first at the last<br>Thursday, other car was at following. The day was really hot like sauna day,<br>but it still cannot stop our passion for this meeting. The distance from the downtown<br>to Pan Shan is about 80 kilo meters away, it took about one hour and 15 minutes<br>by car. I simply assigned the rooms for them each, we were starting to make the<br>lunch immediately, you know my friends are all the good at cooking, so I just<br>opened my mouth to speak what they wanted in the kitchen, after a half hour<br>everything was on the table with delicious cold noodles and green vegetables I<br>expected.</p>
<p>At the late afternoon outside is still hot, one of my friend<br>Huang she was the first time to come my home, she took a lot pictures at my<br>courtyard, the grape, kiwi and some green flowers she said it was amazing to be<br>here. After drinking we went out to the swimming pool where is not too far only<br>next to my community, taken the photo was our favourite thing to show, asking<br>the lifeguard for helping us the group photo before we swam. </p>
<p>At the second morning we got up early, we had a simple<br>breakfast quickly, but I did not forget to open my music with deco, one side<br>was dancing, while laughing and watching at my courtyard. The fair must be<br>early to go, so we had to stop my music.</p>
<p>How nice the meeting we had! I love you my friends, I<br>hope you can come to my home as many times as you can, we will have a wonderful<br>time for sure.</p>

Up to now, just several days after its release, the film has refreshed the Chinese film record of box office, accompanying overwhelming publicity such as Chinese great science fiction and positive comments of audience, which really attract us to watch this film.Regarding a film with such good reputation or important accomplishment, I feel like to share my opinion after watching it and viewing related comments of external critic on line.  As common audience, the film demonstrated a fantastic story, with exciting and touching storyline, with fascinating visual effects.The background of the story is about the near future of solar galaxy and mankind, when the sun ages and continues to expand drastically and eventually gobbles up the earth. The emergency pushes the United Earth Government consolidates the world to build thruster net involving thousands of engines to move the planet out of the solar galaxy and then enter a new galaxy with similar circumstance with actual solar galaxy. As passing by the Jupiter, Earth is captured by immense gravity and deviated from predefined orbit, which could cause eventually the collision of the Jupiter and the Earth. The mankind faces to be ruined.A family of Chinese astronaut progressively involves in the final mission of rescuing Earth, as a major storyline throughout the entire film. This family is composed by grandfather Han Ziang a senior driver of heavy vehicle of “Post- Solar Galaxy Age”, father Liu Peiqiang Chinese astronaut volunteered to join in international space station for decades, son Liu Qi raised by his grandfather and separated with farther about 4 years old as well as a adopted girl, small sister of Liu Qi, a survival of a catastrophe after Earth stopped rotation, saved by Han Ziang. Finally, the grandfather and the father devote their life to complete the Earth rescuing mission.Although certain critic think the emotional story could not express real or complete feeling, the majority plot is developed smoothly and reasonably. But honestly, the introducing of the members of urgency rescuing team is relatively abrupt without any previous mention especially to the programmer Li Yi, such important role to the final mission. Regarding the tension between Liu Qi and his long-absent father Liu Peiqiang and the sudden change of Duoduo from a whiny toddler to final speaker, it’s better to understand by approaching Chinese culture. In Chinese traditional family, the image of the father is often serious, unsmiling or not communicating directly with the children especially to their son. The emotion between father and son in China is sometimes subtle.Then, the Chinese traditional culture influencing Chinese children from an early age is of collectivist culture, which enables them to learn a habit of thinking from the collective interest, even though they have no way to completely overcome their naive side. So the stirring speech that Duoduo made at the end is such difficult to the children of her age in China.The critical approach of external review from foreign critic is obviously professional, but the pressing, embarrassed or even no-real feeling on the communication between Chinese families and colleagues is probably caused by cultural misunderstanding.</p>

The changeable weather makes no possibility of experiencing a smooth spring.  You have little chance to decide what kind of smart clothes you are to wear. Because it always ends up quickly and then comes the summer. The moist of air is the ideal environment for mosquitoes. They come and bite and suck. What a tiny little creature which can be so strong at blood sucking. I do not know if there are vampires but I realize they are the real version of Dracula. They can be found in desert. They can be still on walls or somewhere else when it gets cold and come out again as it is warm enough to activate them. If I were bothered as they hum before I fall asleep, I would kick the bucket. After getting up, itchy hands remind me of their banquet. It is not that bad, what a good news, at least, I did not know the buzz thanks to their silent party on my arms.</p>

Finally, the sun comes out. While the bad news is it will rain again the day after tomorrow and it will not end till in the next early month. So I went out this evening to run around. I have not done outdoors workout for more than two weeks as of the Spring Festival. And I do not want to wast this chance before the arrival of rain. On the way, the dusty air caused by the site of subway construction. I did not care about that and ran all the way. The reason I run is I enjoy the joviality when I breathe. After sweating, then I took a bath, I was to be refreshed and energetic. Another week is coming. Good night.</p>
