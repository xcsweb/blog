As time goes by, memories of good old days seem to vanish away. There is no more common ground for the rich and the poor. Different people have different focuses so there is no common topic worth discussing.But if we keep a normal and calm mentality to view this matter, we’ll find high school reunions are interesting things and have their meanings. We can find those common students have become excellent people and contrary to the good students who turned to ordinary ones. Actually, those phenomenon are not important to me. I will gladly attend high school reunions and see my friends spending happy lives and those lovely girls from the past remained beautiful. We might recall all kinds interesting things while we attending the reunions. </p>

They are all stocked up in the fridge. With all the things prepared well, I can spend my time reading something. I have finished a book, the Innocent Anthropologist, which is a funny and interesting one with the protagonist who is the author of this book narrated his experience of his study among a primitive tribe in a remote place in Cameroon. The English traveled far away from his country to a backward tribe in Africa. During his study, he suffered a lot which was supposed to be a painful and unforgettable memory, on the contrary, became a story that it surely will make you belly laugh since his sense of humor let that story vividly impressive.I admire his positive attitude to life and study. And I get to know anthropologists sometimes are considered to be a group of crazy people who do their studies that you hardly get what its real meaning is. While this point is clearly important that we usually neglect that something does exist on the planet and we never or seldom read their life.Besides, thanks to the translator’s work on this book. From characters, I can sense the humor from the author which bring me the experience of the job about the what an anthropologist usually does.When the modern civilization conflicts with uncivilized culture, it definitely generates some huge shocks on our recognition. What an amazing world. There are still many unknown things deserved to discover and explore.</p>

Some people hold that the best way of<br>learning about life is by listening to the advice from family and friends.<br>However, other people hold that it could be achieved through personal<br>experience. As to me, I agree with the second opinion.</p>
<p>For one thing, it seems to be true that from<br>other people you can get some suggestions about life, but it doesn’t mean that<br>others ideas could be applied to your life situations, for each person is<br>different from others in his background and life style. For another, it could<br>also be argued that family and friends’ ideas could be helpful, but your<br>personal experience teachers you more about how to achieve success, how to deal<br>with different people. It is often said that we learn something by doing it in<br>person.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first idea cannot stand up to<br>our real life. We should learn about life in practice.</p>

Just by occasionally we were told<br>by BUBU’s mother, The Book Worm where is not too far from the home, somewhere<br>in San Li Tun area. This is the book store with some drinks; the books are all English<br>original books, some for adult, some for kids as well. There are a few tables<br>and simple wooden chairs with traditional cotton pattern table cloth, the light<br>is not too strong, a little dark, You can read there for whole day quietly, why<br>I like there, not only for the books, but also I like the sense and the atmosphere.</p>
<p>San Li Tun area is more modern and famous place in<br>Beijing, there are many embassies and bars located, that’s why many of foreigners<br>from different countries come in this book store. There is one teacher from<br>Kenya who is leading the class for baby in the store at every Friday morning. I<br>took our baby and BuBu to the class at the last week; you paid to the Chinese coffee<br>girl by wechat each time before the class.</p>
<p>The teacher prepared many toys and Chinese songs and<br>English songs for kids, most of the kids are 0+-2 years old only, the class is<br>about one hour more, many of young mothers is holding the baby to the class on<br>time, some are the wives of the ambassador and senior executive. I can say western<br>education is to pay attention to the interaction between mother and baby, I was<br>curious there are no any babies crying, the baby looks like knowing nothing,<br>but just showing them harmonies sense and feeling, I was trying to follow the<br>teacher sing the song with the body language to talk with my baby. It was<br>really great time there, and I have known how to talk with baby nicely in the future.</p>

At the beginning, the route we lived in was happy, how to be happy and how to survive.    What is the long semester for, in order to be curious about new knowledge? Access to wisdom? Later we used for find resources of survival. This is part of the material of life. If you only need to be happy, you only need to play the game every day, but the material part is indispensable. From this we have produced something that is connected to society—-work. What work is the direction of our lives.   I feel that there are two conditions in the direction of life. The first is to obtain resources for survival and protect themselves. Second, I can forget everything in it, forget the outside world, forget myself, and forget “forgot.”</p>

Absolutely, it&apos;s a happy time to most of us especially after long time work overtime, no doubt everyone expects the vacation in company. Fortunately, there is no mandatory instruction of working overtime during vacation from high lever. From my side, I need make an arrangement in advance go outside for relaxing myself with my family, it will be perfect if the weather is good enough. Currently, I don&apos;t know how the weather will be during seven days holiday, but, I hope it won&apos;t spoil my good mood when I am in vacation. I should spend more time accompany family and take my kids looking around the city, it may don&apos;t need to go far away just to cherish the happy time with my kids instead of watching cell phone at home. Even I did a terrible time during the past weeks and I could take this opportunity to adjust myself to think about which steps I should do, to continue this kind of style of life or encourage myself to jump out current zone to find a something new. This question has already confused me a lot these days, currently, I still can&apos;t respond it. I have too many concerns and worry about myself whether I have strong enough to pursuit something new outside. Can I accept the result of starting from scratch? Maybe the answer is negative.
