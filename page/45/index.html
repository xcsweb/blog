But, it seems that I have just finished my first truly dating in life today, 5 hours ago I think, which last for nearly the whole day. I am wandering on what I have got, what I want to get, and what I want to get next. Only one thing is obvious—23th Febrary in 2019 has been a big day in my life, a landmark, a huge progress, though I achieved nothing accutually.I care little about boys in the passed whole life since I was in middle school, the time most girls begin to think about boys. Chat among friends on love or how to be loved used to be a boring topic in my years, especially in selfstudy lessons. Until years passed by, each acquaintance I met during the Chinese New Year asked me if I have a boyfriend. I have thought over this problem carefully after I entered college and make several conclusion about the adventages and disadvantages on myself on this problem. With a little embarrassment and boredom, I occupied myself with perfessioned books and the colorful world. Maybe not everyone can love like those legend in movies, I confort myself.The boy say hello to me in swimming pool as well as ask for we-chat nember. Neither is he the first one who show  favourate to me nor the first one to ask for phone number, and I felt nothing about him as usual.  The different is, I thought it’s time to go for the messy problem. So I tried. Do online chat like stories or friends midnight talks, and appointed time for the first dating on the last day of my winter holiday.Today is neither the first time I go skating this winter, nor the first time I go out with a boy alone, but truly the first dating in my life when I care about things between boy and girl only through the process. An boy always want to show his gentility in face of an girl, so did this one. So I find excuses such as “to find sit in the classroom for the new sesmester” to show my shyness and hardworking and made the plan. We walked through my school in the morning, had lunch together in a restaurant I supposed, and went skating in the afternoon. I said a lot of myself, much more than he said about himself. As a result I have a pain on my throat just now.To simply say happpy or love is not the truth. Now that it is a meaningful moment as the first dating, I must find something to fulfill my attitude towards life. Firstly, this boy is not my sweet. I still feel nothing about him now and he talked a little but touched me a lot during the day. Secondly, if I can’t learnt how to love a boy in the future, just follow the boyfriend selecting rules is ok. Thirdly, to chase my own life is much more meaningful than finding a dreaming boyfriend. And finally, how to reject someone is proper and decent when he just bought you a bundle of rose which seems to be expensive?</p>

This life is easy to get tired too cause there is without a clear aim. Things look obscurity.  For the people we have a lot of words to say but without saying it out. When there are so much words unsaid, it is not easy to guess what are the really feeling too.  I want to know do love really conquer all? I doubted! Maybe I just do not meet my luck! I hope all is good!</p>

It is almost the<br>end of story this week; I am one of these series trackers although I seldom<br>watch TV at home except this one.</p>
<p>There is the very traditional Chinese family with<br>three children, two elder brothers and one youngest sister, the parents were<br>very look up to men and down on women, preferred boys than girls. As well the<br>birth control policy at that period, the third child was punished a lot money<br>for this family, the mother was very tough and she was the master of this family.<br>So many of complains of house affairs was blamed to the girl, for example<br>during the school time, the mother forced her daughter to gave up key<br>university to a teacher college which was much cheaper cost and easy to find the<br>job after graduation to support his brother. </p>
<p>The elder brother was an immigrant to US for ten<br>years, the second boy was spoiled by his mother, he always received financial<br>support from parents, so the second and the girl were fighting each other at home<br>all the time, unfortunately the father who was so weak and selfish in this<br>family, he was never responsible for each one at this among of unhealthy family,<br>the youngest girl run away from home at her 18 years old, and she never came<br>back to the sad home even living in the same city for 10 years. </p>
<p>The surface of the family was good, but after the<br>mother was dead, everything was changed, unexpected things were hardly control.<br>The retired life and accommodation for their father was the main issue in front<br>of three children, to break the peaceful life of them. The father finally got<br>rid of his wife, in many situations of the daily life, he was making any unreasonable<br>troubles even more severe demands on their children. Compel the elder one went<br>back home from oversee and having serious family argument.</p>
<p>Having the great prospect was the girl she was working<br>in the big company to be a GM, helping her by her Shi Fu when she was a little<br>girl. She was a rich white collar with big houses and luxury car. Even she swore<br>she will never touch the family again, but because of the family affection, she<br>has settled and helped many cases for this family quietly. </p>
<p>Finally all members of family knew that even we were<br>from one family, but the communication each other was the most important thing<br>in this family.  </p>

We have to stop to find the identity card and swip to enter,  that&apos;s terrible experience when I take many things in my hand or wear a thick gloves and riding a e-bike.  The door will closed in less than half minutes,  we always worried it will closed suddenly and hit us.      That must be some ways to improve the doors.      But I found an interesting thing in the other hand.  The door will keep open if you cover the sensors of the door  with your hand .  So, we have been used to cover the sensor for others when we pass the door.  We conscious to do that for others and we always receive a &quot;thank you&quot; or a grateful smile.  All of us to do that not only the young men but also old men and kids. We always don&apos;t  leave the door until all the people want to go in and out passed at the time,  and maybe we will cover the sensor one by one.  We communicate less and less even we live in the community or as neighbors in the morden world.  The door give us a chance to express our friendly with each other.  That alway make me happy and feel that I live in a good community.      I think it&apos;s a good thing for us although that maybe not safety enough to help &quot;stranger&quot; to enter in our community.

<p>She was still working in Cambodia since three years<br>ago, every meeting we had was only when she came back and I was strongly<br>complain her about ignore my existence, I knew how busy she was, sometime she is<br>a frequency traveller for her business, maybe one night in Beijing and the next<br>day in Shen Zhen, I can understand. But this long holiday spring festival I had<br>to meet her, so I asked her at the long time ago, before one week of the<br>meeting, I said, hi my dear, when I can borrow you entirely, only one day<br>please. She knew it was a joke, this was the way in between.</p>
<p>Luckily we met at yesterday was the third day of lunar<br>day, I was told she missed me as same as mine, She wanted to see me at the<br>first holiday day, She was afraid to missing the chance, because of Chinese new<br>year is important for the family, she can not control her time sometime. I<br>found a restaurant very special, delicious seafood dumpling and mango yoghurt<br>which are our favourite.</p>
<p>I am so happy to know she is learning Gu Zheng<br>instrument to kill her leisure time and show me the songs she play in MP3, it<br>is amazing I cannot believe she can does so well, she is smart. What I can report<br>to my performance of this year is my book of 2018, and told her I am still<br>study EF English which I learn every day for one class on line. The mean is I<br>don’t waste my golden time, I am still a good student consciously.</p>
<p>Anyway, the time was so short, after I knew she has<br>not had the plan to stop her work yet, I told her as long as you are happy with<br>your work and good healthy, you do what you like, I am always support you and<br>waiting you come back in Beijing every day.</p>

</code></pre><p>festival holidays, as normal, some guys whose hometown are far away from<br>working place have asked for leave in advance in order to avoid rush hours on<br>freeway. Inevitably, no matter how many days you ask for leave ahead of<br>holiday, the only way which must be passed have already stuck in heavy traffic<br>for driving long distance back to hometown. It was really a spectacle during<br>the past years which there are no many means of transportations except by<br>ordinary train. That is also a golden age for scalpers, nowadays, as the<br>increasing of private car and public transportations developed in recent five<br>years. There are more choices for selection especially more and more people<br>choose to take private car as the first option, not only it is convenient for<br>moving for visiting relatives during holidays, but it can greatly save time<br>that you don’t need wasting time in the station to waiting train or bus which<br>could be late. But, taking private cars also has their problems that too many<br>cars surged through freeway during several holidays caused traffic jam, what’s<br>more, the terrible thing is if you are clogged in freeway that means you will<br>endure hunger, thirst even can’t find a place for pee. Normally, before spring<br>festival, the passenger flow will follow up the direction that from east and<br>south to west and north. After spring festival, the opposite passenger flow<br>will do over that really a big challenge to public transport. Anyway, each<br>means of transport has its advantage and disadvantage, I hope everyone can<br>enjoy a happy time and safely go and come. </p>

I am supposed<br>to have a laid-back life, to have a lot of time to rest. But supposed is a<br>trick word and you never know.  Here’s my schedule for today and you can<br>say it has nothing to do with laid-back.   Get up at 6:30, prepare breakfast, and then<br>drive my son to school. Spend two entire hours in tidying up the rooms. Considering<br>the fact that I had five days in hospital, and I have to say that is a hell of lot<br>work. Do the laundry, prepare and have lunch.  Then I go to the bank and the community<br>service center to prove one thing: I can’t afford my hospital bills and I need<br>help. Really it’s a simple math problem and even a primary school student can<br>tell that my family income is less than my hospital bills. Besides, when I started<br>my THP therapy, my doctor told me that if I paid 9 perjeta and I could get 10<br>for free. Nobody mentioned that “free” requires of an extremely complicate<br>process, which like the hospital, the insurance company, refuses any kind of reasonable<br>simplifying, even just for a simple math problem. This process involves my company,<br>my husband’s company, community service, the bank, my parents, Civil office bureau,<br>department of housing management….  So, that’s just a start. BTW, I haven’t got<br>my request approved by the community service, because the person in charge was<br>on a meeting.   Now when I finally come home, I have daily<br>learning to finish, dinner to prepare, a son to pick up, homework to check….</p>
<p>Time always rushes by in the hustle and bustle of life,  anyway, anytime and anyhow.  </p>
