The event<br>would be hold at SKP Beijing where is her company, and this is the final<br>competition after select 300 participants, due to her relationship our baby<br>would not take the first round, direct into the final game. That’s why she wanted<br>us to cheer for our baby at the day.</p>
<p>Balance bike is kind of bike without step plate and it<br>is only for baby, right not it very popular, you can see it everywhere in<br>playground. As we were told there were many qualification babies who have taken<br>the professional class only for this kind of bike to join the event of the day.<br>So this match must be a splendid party, let our baby to take more chances to<br>see and open his eye instead of only staying at home before go to kindergarten.</p>
<p>There were four groups by age, for 2-3 years old group<br>is the first group would be starting at 9.30am at Yesterday, one by one is<br>going at set the circuit with four kind of obstacle blocks, the baby has to go through<br>without any helps, the faster is to be winner. Xiao Bao likes the bike so much,<br>this is one of his favourite toys, as long as any outings he prefers to ride<br>it, and the bike is safer then walking or running for 2 and half years old baby,<br>maybe he asked for hug shamelessly if everyone is around him. So any obstacle on<br>the way he has can do it well and easily, I do believe Xiao Bao can be complete<br>the match for sure.</p>
<p>There are about 20 babies and their parents have been<br>checked in at the counter, Ours is Number 2, lucky number, the sticker of number<br>should be sticking on each bike before register, seems everything is<br>professional, the scene is very living and vivid with disco music, due to some<br>sunshine boys was playing street dance and hip-hop to encourage babies has good<br>performance.</p>
<p>I was ready to be the photo photographer at the site<br>to record the great moment during him perform, after the host said to start,<br>Xiao Bao was so handsome with his helmet go out from starting point sharply, I<br>did not see any afraid from his face, each of blocks on the way he did very<br>freely, seemed that he understood he must be hard work, he was really not a baby,<br>he was a big boy, I was so exciting to move my camera and following his figure<br>slowly to record, after he crossed the final line smoothly, the cheer up and<br>the round applause by audience for him was so loud and exciting.</p>
<p>The result is not so important thing for them. In fact,<br>what you have got from the game that you took part in is most important than, I<br>do believe he and my daughter learned a lots from it, I hope more and more<br>babies and their family would think about it, trying to take more chances like<br>this. Every baby to participate has the medal after event, which is the first<br>medal for him in his life; hopefully he will get more medals in the future.</p>
