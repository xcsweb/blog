Will had been ahunter before he joined the Night&apos;s Watch , Weill,a pacher in truth,Mallister freeriders had caught him red-handed in the Miallisters;s own woods,skinning one of the Maillisters;s own bucks,and it had been a choice of putting on the black or losing a hand.No one could move through the woods as selent as Will, and it had not taken the black brethers long to discover his talent.&quot;The camp is two miles farther on , over that ridge, hard beside a stream  I got close as I dared , There;s eight of them , men and women both, No children I could see, they put uo alean to against the rock, The snow;s pretty wel vocered it now, but I could strill make it out , no fire butning , but the firepit was strill plain as day, No one moving,I watched a long time , No loving man ever lay so strill&quot;     &quot;did you see any blood?&quot;    &quot;no&quot;    &quot;Did you see any weapons?&quot;    &quot;some swords , a few bows, one man had an axe, heavt-looking, double - bladed, a cruel piece of iireon,It was on the ground beside him, right by his hand&quot;    &quot;did you make onte of the position of the bodies?&quot;    Will shrugged :a couple are sitting up against the rock, most of them on the ground Fallen, like or sellping:    &quot;threre;s oone woman up an ironwood, half hid in the branches a far eyes I tiik care she never saw me. when I got closer,I saw that she wasn;t moving neither;&quot;
