watching listening thinking its long slow thoughts his mile was gentle you listen to too many of old nans stories the others are as dead as the children of the forest gone eight thousand years maester luwin will tell you they never lived at all no livinig man has ever seen one until this morning no living man had ever seen a firewolf either c reminded him I ought to know better than to argue with a t he esaid with reeful smile he slid ice back into its sheath you did not cometo tell me crib tales I know how little you like this place what is my lady c took her busbands hand there was grievous news today my lord i didi not wish to tourble you until you had cleansed yourself there was no way to soften the blow so she told him sreight i am so sorry my love jon a is dead his eyes found hers and she could see how hard it took him ,as she had known it would , in his youth ned had fostered at the e and the childless lord a had become a second father to him and his fellow ward when the mad

direwolf dead in the snow a broken antler in its throat dead coiled within her like a snake but she forced herself to smile at this man she loved this man who pit no faith in sign i knew that would
