When I was backing home, Tiger told me<br>his heart rate was so fast, and he had taken saving pills. I can see he looked<br>so uncomfortable from his face; I picked him to the sofa and let him lying down<br>immediately.</p>
<p>Everybody around Tiger knew that he has the<br>heart disease for some years, at the two years ago he had had heart operation<br>which was taken three hours, it was called Fang Shan in medical, even we<br>invited the famous doctor did the operation for him, we were so happy to know<br>it was perfect operation, after the time the heart attack came around once, we<br>did not go to hospital, just let him sitting down for a while, he was becoming normal.</p>
<p>But this time the data was showing 180 t in 15 minutes,<br>I was a little shuck and asked him to the hospital at once. You know Ji Xian is<br>only a small county in Tian Jian, There is a hospital far to our home around 20<br>km away. The time was limit for a heart attack person. I forced him into the car<br>to the hospital immediately.</p>
<p>I must say Tiger was so coolness facing the troubles;<br>he was opening GPS for the direction and called his friends for the helps on<br>the car, even there were many rate limited on the traffic, it was taken 20<br>minute more on the way, the speed of rate heart was still fast, I was so worry<br>about Tiger, I can see T-Shirt of Tiger was totally wet, I had to make sure<br>everything safe for my driving I told myself.</p>
<p>Luckily his friends had been waiting him at the<br>hospital in advance; I should thank so much to his friends here. Few of them<br>carried him to the emergence room directly. People says that good people<br>believes in pay backs. Yes it was, the doctor was a so experience woman, she<br>was calm down and let him injection a shot, his heart was becoming smoothly. How<br>dangerous he was? I understood people’s life was just in one second, if you did<br>not know how serious for the heart attack person, you might not see him today.<br>Luckily we went to the hospital instead of staying at him, luckily his friends were<br>so reliable, Luckily the doctor was so cool for a shot, Luckily Tiger was so<br>smart and strong when we were on the way. Back to think about those, I was so<br>fear after the horrible disaster.</p>
