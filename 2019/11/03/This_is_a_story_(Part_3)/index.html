<p>“Dragon Alley, the Tenth Street” Sabrina heard a familiar demanding voice coming from<br>the other side phone “About ten o’clock, you would see a man in grey dumping<br>the garbage. Take it and meet me at the cottage.” Before Sabrina said anything,<br>he hung up the phone. “Damn it! Sabrina cursed, “A textbook example of a chauvinist.”</p>
<p>No matter how displeased with his bossy<br>manner, three hours later Sabrina still showed up in front of the cottage, with<br>a bag of stinky garbage. And another half an hour later, Lord Howard—the only name<br>he gave to Sabrina–finally found what he’s looking for: a very strange looking<br>white box. It was obviously being brutally destroyed. Lord Howard murmured<br>something, casting a spell to reconstruct the original text on it. Two Words finally showed up, but Sabrina couldn’t<br>recognize them. “Changchun Changsheng” he explained it to Sabrina: “It’s bio-technology<br>company in China, one of the Muggle Countries. This company sold the inferior<br>vaccines to more than 250000 children. About two years ago this terrible scandal outbroke, gripped<br>this country, and put the entire nation into crisis of faith.  Nature of greed, something can always stand<br>the test of time.  Anyway, afterwards it was shut down. But the<br>drugs, vaccines inventory also disappeared.” </p>
<p>Chapter 13：than thank that<br>the theatre</p>
<p>“Excuse me, my lord. But what<br>does that have to do with anything?”<br>Sabrina blurted out. She felt that she was almost drowning in a whirlpool of<br>puzzles. Hardly had she solved one than<br>another came up. </p>
<p>“Might or might not. But when<br>your father thought Buck was smuggling sugar into this country, he made a<br>mistake. What Buck really shipped was those vaccines from China. And he with the vaccines were last seen in Dragon<br>Alley, where Spitz, one of the most powerful wizards, is said to live.” Sabrina<br>was momentarily dumbfounded by this news. “But what for? Our children don’t need<br>vaccines against any infectious disease. And you told me Spitz was behind all<br>this?” “Scared?” he chuckled. “Of course not, what else could I possibly have<br>to lose? It’s just like fitting tiny pieces together to form a giant piece, but<br>all you got is just small part of it, and you don’t know which one fits where,<br>that’s all.” “Then go to Theater de<br>Paris at midnight, and you might find another piece in Box Five.” “What?<br>“Sabrina raised her voice almost to a shout, “You want me to go to a haunted box<br>in a haunted theatre at midnight? Thanks,<br>but no thanks!” </p>
<p>Chapter 14: their, theirs, them,<br>themselves, then</p>
<p>Then at midnight, Sabrina found herself stumbling along a<br>muddy lane. At the end of it was a dark, huge building—the Theatre de Paris.<br>For a ruin it was in good condition, as though the place was still being used.<br>If there was any place in this world that Sabrina was afraid of, here it was.<br>In fact, it scares off everyone in this kingdom. Their deeply-rooted fears could trace back into decades ago. Once<br>Theatre de Paris was the favorite place of theirs,<br>with its elegant style and mesmerizing performances, this theatre gripped their<br>attentions and attracted them like<br>moths to the flames. Anyway, it is one of those places where people would<br>indulge themselves in pure pleasures<br>of sensations.</p>
<p>Chapter 15:  there, these, they, thick, thief</p>
<p>Its other great claim to fame was<br>its owner—Erik. There were a lot of<br>rumors going on about him, but none of these<br>could tell where he came from, who he really was, and even what he looked<br>like—because was never seen without a thick<br>mask on his face. Only one thing they had known for sure: he had incredible<br>talents in music. That’s the major reason for its overwhelming popularity. No<br>one could resist the temptation of the music in Don Juan Triumphant, which<br>Erick created it himself, and they<br>called it as “Music from the Angels.” Everything had changed when one night, a thief, broke into his room and stole a<br>ring, which he had never took it off his finger. How did that thief managed to<br>steal it—it was still a mystery and would remain a mystery forever. Because the<br>next morning the thief found died, in the most terrible way, at home and the<br>stolen ring was gone.</p>
<p>Chapter 16: thin, thing, think,<br>third, thirteen</p>
<p>And almost at the same time, the splendid<br>Theater De Paris was gone, replaced by a ghastly, haunted building. Since that<br>day no one could be able to come near to this place—including the most powerful<br>wizard. Every year at three o’clock am in July 13th, people could hear someone singing the most heartbreaking song<br>from a distance. The song was sad, but surprisingly it had sort of healing<br>power, giving hope to the hopeless, and making you cry and smile at the same<br>time. There was only one person who could enter this building—Sabrina. It was<br>supposed to be a secret, a secret only Sabrina and her father knew. Many years<br>ago, on July 13th, Sabrina’s 6-year-old birthday, she got lost in Third Street. The crowd gradually thinned off and then Sabrina found<br>herself in a dark lane with no one else around. This dark and hard building,<br>abandoned by the summer light, should make her scared. However instead, a sense<br>of loneliness stole over her. Something in this building was calling for her,<br>alluring her to come closer. And the strangest thing happened, the invisible wall which blocked everyone out<br>disappeared. Without a second thought,<br>Sabrina entered in the Theatre De Paris.</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Thirty,<br>this, those, though thought</p>
<p>What<br>had happened next was a blur. Theatre De Paris was like those palaces in fairy tales which had been cursed and abandoned,<br>waiting in the last thirty years for<br>the one who could break that cruse to show up. The dusky light inside seemed to<br>create more shadows, instead of driving them away. Suddenly Sabrina heard someone<br>moving, with a light, stealthy step, up to the stairs. Without troubling for a<br>reason, she followed up. The footsteps stopped at Box 5. But it was empty.<br>Sabrina started to panic and tried to get out. Just then, she heard this most unforgettable music, so<br>beautiful, so mesmerizing, so unbelievably wonderful. She thought everything inside, every piece of her soul, seemed to be drawn<br>out toward the invisible singer. When it was over, she caught a glimpse of a<br>shadow moving. “Wait! Please…” she ran toward it. The shadow pause, though, for just a few seconds. It was<br>enough for Sabrina to catch it up. She raised her head and only saw a pair of<br>scorching eyes, like a wild wounded animal, like the death itself. And she<br>remembered nothing more until she recovered consciousness at her home.</p>
<p>Day 19: Thousand, three, through,<br>throw Thursday</p>
<p>When the setting sun threw long shadows over the sea, the<br>last sunlight filtered through<br>Sabrina’s window. </p>
<p>“How could you<br>get into that theatre?” For a thousand<br>times, his father asked and for a thousand times, Sabrina couldn’t give out an<br>answer. It’s dangerous to be different, especially for a normal little girl to do<br>something that a wizard couldn’t. </p>
<p>“Promise me, my<br>dear, what happened on Thursday<br>night is a secret. Never mention about it, and never, never go to that place<br>again” </p>
<p>Until now, Sabrina still<br>remembered quite clearly her father’s face when he said that. However, fate<br>once again led her along the same lane into the unknown. </p>
<p>And it’s three minutes to go<br>before the midnight.</p>
<p>Day<br>20: Ticket, tie, till, time, tired. </p>
<p>Just<br>as Sabrina was about to step into the building, she heard a tired voice whispering by the ear: “Got<br>you. “The hair on Sabrina’s whole body stood up and time seemed to stand still for this moment. And then<br>she must have blacked out for a couple of minutes. The next thing she knew, she<br>was tied tightly by some magic spell<br>to the tree outside of the theatre. She struggled to break it free, only was<br>interrupted by the voice that felt upon her ear saying in vicious tone: “Dear<br>ghost, you rejected my offer twice. But I guess this time it would be<br>different. See, I got my free ticket,<br>didn’t I? “The invisible rope that around her neck suddenly tightened up.<br>Sabrina felt her life slowly draining away, and she couldn’t help letting out a<br>whining. </p>
