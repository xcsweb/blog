voices raised in song the tullys kept a gods wood as all the great houses did but it was only a place to walk or read or lie in the sun worship was for the sept for her sake ned had bulkt a mall sept where she might sing to the serven faces of god but the bllod of the first men still flowed in the veins of the starks and his own gods wrer the old ones the nameless faceless gods of the green wood they shared with the vanished children of the forest at the center of the frove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters w were black and cold the heart treee ned called it the weirewoods bark was white as bone it leaves dark red like a thousand bllodstatined hands a face had been carved in the trunk of the great tree it features long and melancholy the deep cut eyes red with dried sao and strrangely watchful they were old those eyes older than winterfell itself they had seen brandon the builder set the first stone if the tales were true they had watched the castle s granite walls rise around them it was said that the children of the forst had carved the faces in the trees during the dawn centuries before the coming of the first men across the narrow sesa in the south the last weirwoods had been cut down or burned out a thoudsand years ago except on the isle of faces where the green men keot their silent watch up here it was different here every casstle had it godswood and every godswood had its heart tree and every heart tree its face    c found her husband beneath the weirwood seated on a moss covered stone , the gratsword ice was across this lap and he was cleaning the blade in those waters black as night a thousand years of humus lay thick upon the godswood floor swallowing the sound of her feet but the red eyes of the weirwood seemed to follow her as the same ned she called softluy he lifted his head to look at her he said his voice was sdistant and formal where are the children he would always ask her that in the kitchen arguing about nbames for the wolf pips she soread heer cloak on the forest floor and sat she could feel the eyes watching her but she did her best to ignore them Arya is already in love and Sansa is charmed and gracious but rickon is not quite sure    is he afraid  alttle she admitted he  is noly 3 he must learn to face his fears he will not be three forever and winter is coming yes the  words gave her a child as they always did the stark words every noble house had its words family mottoes touchstones prayers of sorts they boasted of honor and glory promised loyalty and truth swore faith words not for the first time she reflected on what a strange people these northerners were the man died well I will give him that Ned said he had a swatch of oiled leather in one hand he ran it lightly up the greatsword as he spoke polishing the metal to dark glow I was glad for brans sake you would have been proud of bran i am always proud of bran watching the sword as he stroked it she could see the rippling deep within the steel where the metal had been folded back on itself a hundred time in the forging had no love for swords but she could not deny that ice had its own beauty it had been forged in valyrica before the doom had come to the old freehold when the irosmiths had worked their metal with spells as well as hammers 4 hundred years old it was , and as sharp as the day it was forged the name it bore was older still a legacy from the age of heroes when the startks were king in the notth     he was the 4 this year ned said grimly the poor man was half mad something had put a fraer in him sodeep that my word could not reach him he sighed ben writes that the srength of the noght watch is down below a thousand itis not only desertions they are loseing men on rangingsa as well is it  the wilding who else ne lifted ice looked down the cool streel length of it and it will onlu grow worse the day may come when I  will have no chice but to call the banners and ride notth to deal with this king beyond the wall for good and all
