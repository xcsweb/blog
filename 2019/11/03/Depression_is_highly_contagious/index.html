But it’s online and I need<br>an outlet. And it’s just becoming overwhelming. Perhaps I am just<br>over-concerned, hysteria maybe. Hope I could feel better once I sort it out in<br>words. </p>
<p>A vista opened out just for a minute before<br>this holiday, short family trip, and all the fun we could have in the<br>neighborhood, food, natural beauty and pure joy of being together. However, the<br>blackness shut down again. The blackness has another name as “midlife crisis”<br>or more precisely, husband’s health, physically or probably mentally.  </p>
<p>My husband felt dizzy, so we went to the<br>hospital. Brain scan showed he had minor cerebral atherosclerosis. It’s not<br>something you can shrug it off. You need to take precautions, regular<br>exercising, eating healthier and taking pills. I guess it’s part of midlife<br>where your body simply is going down. </p>
<p>Some people might just leave it at that.<br>They just elevate their nose with a sniff of indifference and dismiss it from<br>their minds and go on with their life. I am one of them. I know that’s not<br>sensible. My husband, on the contrarily, goes to another extreme. It worries<br>him to death, occupying his whole mind, turning him into a total stranger. Honestly,<br>I don’t know which side is worse. </p>
<p>I should see it coming. I have married him<br>long enough to be on my guard against this fatal tendency of his. Still I don’t<br>understand why someone who can handle pressures so well, either at work or in<br>family, would be so panicked and scared to get sick? </p>
<p>Now life stretches before him—endless—in a<br>series of days darkened and poisoned by his physical problems. Like that is<br>going to help! No, I know better, how could his anxiety, his worries would<br>worsen his condition, multiple times worsen. </p>
<p>I really got sick of going from one doctor<br>to another, putting him through one treatment to anther which did him no good,<br>repeating words that supposed to be comforting but actually not, and hearing<br>his worries, his endless complaints of pains. And I’m not sure this time we could<br>be lucky enough to stumble across one doctor, not any doctor but must be the<br>doctor of the best—only that he would listen—and that doctor must speak truth<br>and speak it in a vehement way: “A lot of people are worse than you. I’m worse<br>than you. Stop whining, man up and find a job, get back to your life! You<br>should feel luck that your wife is still there. You are in my black list, I would<br>not waste any of my time in you.”  </p>
<p>That’s pretty much what happens in last<br>year when he was diagnosis as slipped disc. I really, really didn’t want to go<br>through that nightmare again. </p>
<p>You know what is the worst part? The worst<br>part is, after going through all these, when coming to his health condition, I can’t<br>trust him. When he feels terrible, I’m not sure if it’s a physical one or a mental<br>one. And my mistrust him irritates him a lot, and we fight over it like a<br>thousand times. Now I’m trying to hide my mistrust, but honestly, I don’t<br>succeed very much. </p>
<p>There is nothing I could do about it.<br>Because it’s his battle, his demon to fight. Saying “don’t worry”, or “it’s not<br>the end of the world”, or “calm down” don’t work—these words would just roll<br>off him like water off a duck’s back.</p>
<p>They say that anxiety and depression isn’t<br>contagious. That’s wrong. It’s highly contagious, indeed, only to one who is<br>the closest to the patient. </p>
<p>I’m so, so, so tired. </p>
