<p>For a long time, I just stared at this<br>message and didn’t know how to react. I need to sort my thoughts out, but how? </p>
<p>I keep falling, and there is no bottom of<br>life. The abyss seems to stretch like forever. </p>
<p>Seven months. Three hospitals, tried all<br>the treatments available and visited countless doctors. No one could give us an<br>explanation. Perhaps there is one but it is not enough to pull me out of<br>suspicions and doubts, which has already torn me apart. </p>
<p>The last visit to the doctor happened about<br>two days ago. </p>
<p>It took me about a whole month to make that<br>appointment and two hours to wait outside. And ten minutes later, we were literally<br>thrown out of the door. </p>
<p>The doctor had a blister tongue, and every<br>word he said seemed to be a slap on the face. </p>
<p>“You are wasting my time. Yes, you have a<br>slipped disc. Yes, it pains. So what? Accept it. Mine is worse than you and I still<br>have a job to do, and a life to live. Okay, I’m telling you this just for the<br>sake of your wife. You are lucky because she is still there. Accept the pains, be<br>a man and get a job!”  </p>
<p>The question is my husband can’t stand it.<br>Perhaps he is just extremely sensitive to the pains, or perhaps long time of<br>lying in bed has finally broke him, eroded his courage, and makes him sort-of<br>addictive to the bed, or perhaps it’s just a matter of time, or perhaps all the<br>doctors have made a huge mistake and his condition is much worsen—-I just don’t<br>know! And all these Perhaps are going to kill me. </p>
<p>I need a break. I start to avoid his company.<br>I don’t know how to face him. There is something burning in my chest<br>threatening to well up. I have to use every ounce of my strength to keep it in<br>check. </p>
<p>“I’m not imaging these pains!” he keeps<br>saying that. And when I was in line to get his medicine, he wanted to come back<br>to the car to lie down, to rest. I exploded: “Then prove him wrong! If I were you,<br>I would bite the bullet to get out of that damn bed. Even it was going to kill<br>me, at least I was telling the world I am not that weak!”—perhaps I was not<br>fair to say that. Just as he said, I didn’t have a slipped disc and I didn’t<br>know what he was going through. </p>
<p>Could it be worse than give a birth? </p>
<p>For the last two days, fairly speaking, he did<br>try his best. He made a record to leave the bed for three to four hours a day,<br>which was already double as the usual. </p>
<p>The pains, the sufferings. And today, on<br>the way to the nearby bread shop, he collapsed. He made it 40 minutes. </p>
<p>What should we do?</p>
<p>Keep trying. Fight. </p>
