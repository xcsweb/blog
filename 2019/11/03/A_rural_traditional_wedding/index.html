The boy and the girl are all from the same area at Shi<br>Lou county of Lv Liang city in Shan Xi山西, where is<br>the most poor mountainous area just next to Shan Xi 陕西. We<br>knew the boy when he was a little boy, due to he is very clever and hard work,<br>Tiger and I likes him so much and we would like him to be our adopted son, that’s<br>why his wedding for sure we would like to give him fully support.</p>
<p>There are four children in his family, the boy is the<br>third one and the last one for the married in his family, we did not think how<br>poor there is, they still live in cave house village which I only saw it in the<br>film that I cannot believe. Due to Shan Xi has many coal mine, that’s why there<br>are many big trucks on the way, the bad air pollution and the traffic are so dangerous<br>for the small car. His parents are all younger than me but they look like 60-70<br>years old, but smiling is so kind and honest I can see, they did not speak so<br>much when we came in to the courtyard, the body language I can read how happy<br>they were. According to the local custom, one day before of wedding, all the<br>villagers, neighbours and relatives have big dinner together gives the presents<br>as returns. At the time the local band with three or four people group were<br>invited as well for the celebration. There was a big red rubber arched door<br>attached name of the bride and the bridegroom. I was told there will be 300<br>more people for the dinner at the night, the chef and kitchen helpers was other<br>group were the most busiest for mess part, the people came for eating all<br>standing there, like running water, one after other, the big pail for food did<br>not like human foods I must say so, but still was gone in a few minutes. Any way<br>I cannot believe and I felt so sad. </p>
<p>The second day morning the wedding was officially started<br>from 11am,Unhealthy custom there were more than 10 black Audi to pick up the bridge;<br>the bridegroom was holding the bridge over his shoulder with the string of firecracker<br>hard to walk, but he had to do like this. Tiger and were honoured to be the<br>chief witness coming to the stage, to showing our loves and wish they will have<br>a great future in the life. One thing was so attractive me till today was the<br>host asked the children and grandsons or granddaughters all went down on their<br>knees for the parents with the harmonious music, this picture was still in my<br>mind cannot take it away. </p>
<p>This was a great wedding party I have never seen<br>before, let me learn a lot and to know there are many rural area like here in<br>China need us to help, to change the traffic situation and let them go out of<br>the mountain area. </p>
