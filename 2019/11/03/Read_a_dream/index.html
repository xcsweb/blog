Tiger and I were invited to join the wedding ceremony at Shan Xi<br>province, we bought the high speed rail tickets to Tai Yuan city first and then<br>somebody picked us up by car to be there. It was a great arrangement I must say<br>so.</p>
<p>I will write the following blog for the special<br>wedding for sure, but today I would like tell my dream was really realize at<br>this trip.</p>
<p>My parents all worked in the institute of Biological<br>Product for the life, at the beginning of 70s years. To be the party members<br>they all eagerly responded to work at the poor regions in China. There were one<br>third about more than 80 families including my family were delegated to Jie Xiu<br>county of Shan Xi province for three years. I was a little girl at the time, I<br>cannot remember the thing clearly, my brothers were the school boys, they<br>always mention to me how poor we were and eating Sorghum flour instead of food<br>all the time, I only remember we lived in the single storey house 15 square<br>meters with 5 people, very limitation space for girl and boys live together. But<br>I can recall we went to the hill at the back of house to pick up wild small dates,<br>which was very prick the hands. </p>
<p>This trip was mainly for the wedding and then Tiger’s<br>brother will meet us by car at the famous Ping Yao ancient city. I was realized<br>the way from the wedding to Ping Yao was passed by Jie Xiu city, and we had<br>enough time to meet his brother. Tiger knew what my dream was, that was the<br>great if we have the chance to go to Jie Xiu I have mentioned before many<br>times. So I cannot believe that Tiger changed our way to my dream place first.</p>
<p>I called my brother to tell the address of the place<br>we can follow GPS to be there very smoothly, even we had asked somebody on the<br>way, we were there. The place was becoming a training centre, because of the<br>holiday, there was nobody there except the door man, the luckily there was one<br>family live there, I was excited to tell why I came here they fully understood<br>my emotional and happy to took me walk around the place, and told me the story<br>here after we left. Some of house has been dismantled, luckily a few houses<br>left liked Historical site, I wanted the time to stop and listen more stories<br>happened here, trying to recall my poor memories at the 40s years ago.</p>
<p>How great dream for many years I realized today, I was<br>so happy and thank Tiger gave me the chance to be here, even our time was<br>limit, I took many photos to stop motion as I can, I have so many words to<br>write about my feeling when I was there, let’s me paste the photos here.</p>
