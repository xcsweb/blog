First of all, you have to kiss goodbye<br>to your orderly, highly structure life, I know sometimes life is a bitch, but<br>at least it’s a healthy bitch. So it’s the end of a normal life. </p>
<p>And then<br>just image that you stripped off in front of male doctors for CT scan, and<br>before you got time to put your cloths back on, the next patient, carried by<br>his son, already broke in. Oh yeah, it’s the end of your privacy. </p>
<p>It’s the<br>end of economical lifestyle—not for me yet, but I guess it might be very soon.<br>Many patient pals start to squander the money. It’s like carrying a bomb in<br>your body and you start to realize “I haven’t enjoyed my life yet! There are so<br>many places I wanted to visit but not, so many items I wanted to buy but not. And<br>what’s the use of saving money any way, for my husband’s next wife? “ So, you<br>see. I used to keep a record of every yuan I spent. This habit has been with me<br>for almost 10 years but now I’m thinking about quit. For example, my account<br>today would be: Breakfast: 10 yuan; Railway: 5 yuan; Hospital: 23981<br>yuan—it’s like a bad joke that hurts. </p>
<p>And<br>sometimes it’s also the end of your dignity or wisdom—I am not sure which one<br>it is. It’s been more than two months since I got ill and I’ve been to the<br>hospital like a hundred times, but I still haven’t figure out some procedures,<br>which combines with Are-you-stupid-kind-of-look from the assistant doctors made<br>me start to question my IQ. </p>
<p>For<br>example, how to buy targeted delivery drugs (PS, extremely expensive) is still<br>a mystery for me. The first time, my doctor wrote my prescription, and I went<br>through some procedures. So at the second time, I assumed it’s the same. My doctor<br>was not there, and her assistant refused to write out prescription because they<br>only write it on every Tuesday. It’s already the last day for my treatment, so I<br>had to beg her to prescribe. I pestered her for about half an hour. She finally<br>agreed, but she threw me her signature killing look, as if saying: “Leave me<br>alone, you filthy insect!”. This time, I remembered the Tuesday thing, and<br>because I was on drip that day, so I asked my mum to do it for me.  Half an hour later, my mum came back with<br>tears in her eyes. I was pretty shocked because my mum seldom cried. That lady,<br>or perhaps she was actually the queen of the universe? still refused to write<br>out prescription. Quote: I didn’t know what you are talking about. Can you even<br>speak? （话都说不清楚！）” My mum was 70 years old.  She might not know the name, but whe brought<br>all the paper with her. My mum asked all the doctors she could find, and<br>finally someone told her where to get the prescription. </p>
<p>I<br>thought this time everything would be OK. I am so navie. When I reported my<br>prescription, and I was told that my application is overdue! Nobody told me<br>anything. And I had to find the queen of the universe again. —-here, I really<br>didn’t want to relieve it. </p>
<p>Another<br>patient once said: “Because of this disease, dignity has become something to<br>stamp on.” Perhaps the queen of the universe really hates us, or perhaps she is<br>just overstressed, either way, it’s not worthy of getting angry. Yeah, perhaps<br>it’s not easy. </p>
<p>You<br>know, it could be worse. But as long as it’s not the end of hope, we could<br>handle it. And hope it’s in our heart, nobody except yourself can end it. </p>
