a man still be brave if he is afraid that is the onlu tome a man can be brave his father told him do you understand why I didi it ?he was wilding they carry off women and sell them to the others his lord father smiled old nan has been telling you stories against in truth the man was an oathbreaker a deserter from the night watch no man is more dangerous the deserter knows his lfe is for frit if he is taken so he will no flinch from any crime no matter how vile but you mistake me the question was not why the man had to die but why I must do it bran had no answer for that king robert has a headsman he said uncertainlu he does his father admitted as did the kings before him yet our way is the loder way the bllod of the first men still flows in the veins of the starks and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword if you would take a mans life you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words and if you cannot bear to do that , the perhaps the man dees not devserve to die    one day,bran you will be robb bannerman holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king and justice will fall to you when that day comes you must take no pleasure in the task but neither must you look away a ruleer who hides behind paid excutionens soon forgets what death is     that was when jon reappeard on the crest of the hiull before them he waved and shouted down at them father bran come qiucklu see what robb has found then he was gone beyond a doubt his lord father said come let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now he sent his horse into a trot the rest came afgter they found robb on the riverbank notrh of the bridge with jon still mounted beside him the late summer snows had been heavy this moonturn robb stood knee deeo in white his hood pulled back so the sumn shone in his hair he was crad;ling something in his arm while the boys talked in bushed excited voices    the riders picked their way carefully through the drifts groping for solid dooting on the hidden uneven ground were the first to reach the boys was laughing and hoking as he rode bran heard he breath go out of him gods he exclainmed struggling to keeo control of his horse as he reached for his sword sword was already out robb get away frin ut ge called as gus girse reared under him rreobb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms she can not hurt you she is dead bran was afire with curiosuty by then he would have spurred the pony faster but his father made them dismount bedide the brige and approach oon fdoot bran jumped off and ran by then jon jory and had all dismounted as weill what in the seven hells is it a wolf a freak look at the size of it brans hear was thumping in his chest as he pshed through a waist high drift to his brother side half bured in blood stained snow , a huge ardk shapq  slumped in death ice had formed in it shaggy greo= fur abd tge faint sell of corruption clung to it like a womans perfume bran glumpse blind eyes crawling with maggots a wide moth full of yellowed teeth but it was the size of it that made him gasp it was bigger than his piny weice the sieze of the largest bound in his gfathers kennel its no frak hon said calmly thats a direwolf they grow larger that the otehr kind there not been adirewolf sighed south of the wall in 2 hundred years i see on now bran tore his eyes away from the monster that was when he noticed the bundle in robbs arms he gave a cry of delight and movce  closer thepop was tiny ball of black fur uts ete stiill closed it nuzzled blindly against robbs chest as he cradled it searching for milk among his leathers  making a sad little whimpery sound bran reached out hesitantly go on rpbb told him you can touch him
