<p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" .="font-size:14.0pt">Today, I am going
to discuss an interesting topic on how to make my technical interview be an
impressive one. </span></p>

<p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" .="font-size:14.0pt">The first thing I
want to mention is that I can decide what skills or experiences are shown to my
interview. I have worked in software testing area for more than ten years, I roughly
know what my interviewer knows and what he expects me to tell him, so I can
prepare some materials for these potential questions. But is it enough to leave
a good impression on him? Definitely not!</span></p>

<p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" .="font-size:14.0pt">Apart from
preparing common questions I probably meet, showing my unique skills and knowledge
is the key to success. An Interview is just like a conversation and everyone
involved it hopes to learn some new and fantastic things, such as cutting edge
technology and methodology, especially when interviewing a top position of a
great technical company. Thus, paying more attention on proving myself unique
will pay off. After all these top companies are looking for great talents and
you have to provide enough evidences on it.</span></p>

<p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" .="font-size:14.0pt">The most important
thing during the interview process is showing my passion. Some vivid examples
can be given and discussed with the interviewer, for instance, it is a good way
to tell them which website I learn testing theory and skills from. Designing and
developing testing platform is another way to express my passion on testing,
after that I can discuss some details with my interviewer. It is better to
explain why I chose to do this and how these knowledge and experience can add
values for my work.</span></p>

<p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" .="font-size:14.0pt">All in all, trying
to dominate the whole interview process is essential and showing your strengths
and talents helps the interviewer define your capability to a great extent. <span .="mso-spacerun:yes">&#xA0;</span></span></p>
