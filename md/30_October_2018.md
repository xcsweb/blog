The wet and dirty weather has been annoying us for three days running. The outdoor work has to be suspended. The rain and snow were really unwelcome and useless at present. Thank heavens！It'll turn fine from tomorrow. 
Renewed my reading of North and South. In the meantime, watched the film adapted from the novel. Found some details in the film different from the original work. Margaret's younger brother Frederick, an escaped criminal, returns stealthily to his mother's deathbed from abroad. Before the funeral he has to depart immediately in case he should be detected and arrested. At Outwood station he is recognized by a drunkard named Leonards who attempts to seize Frederick for gaining the hundreds of pounds of reward.
