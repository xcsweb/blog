Some say movement can prolong
life. As the saying goes, life depends on movement. Only taking more exercise, can
the body of the old undergo a normal process of metabolism. Then his organism
tends to be healthier, with better absorption of nutrients and slower ageing. But
others air another opinion, the old will live longer by resting quietly to
recuperate. The body of the old is quite different from that of the young. Compared
with the organs of the young, those of the old have quite waned. Rash sports
will do more harm than good to the old. They had better set worries aside and
rest and lead a slow pace of life for longevity.
