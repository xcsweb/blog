In 2009, Huang Ling, an examinee from
Mianyang, was specially admitted to Sichuan University because he wrote his Chinese
composition with the style of calligraphy as that of oracle-bone inscriptions of
the Shang Dynasty. Up to now, no other person has ever tried to use that ancient
writing style in his college entrance examination. He got only 428 marks in
total, scoring 8 in the composition. The scores can make him enrolled in one of
the third-class colleges. But a palaeographer in Sichuan University took a
fancy to him for his talent. He applied to the school authority for Huang's admission to his
instruction.
