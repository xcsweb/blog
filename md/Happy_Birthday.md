Yesterday July 29 was my birthday day. One month ago I
was looking forward the day coming, how could I spend my day? What kind of gifts
I can receive from my friends or my family? Hopefully some surprises or miracle
coming to me at the day.

Tiger asked me what kind of gift you want at two weeks
ago, I know he loves me, he was not a pincher at the day to buy something for
me. He never asks what I bought from the internet or shopping mall, only if too
many packages delivery to my home, He might say, please don’t blind to spend
money. 

In fact I really want an unmanned plane or a lap top, anyone
at lease is over 10 thousands, I know it is more expensive for the gift, an
unmanned plane is not so suitable play in Beijing, due to many places are forbidden.
And I have desk top and I pad, which can instead of the lap top I think. So forget
those two. I had a crystal bracelet at the long time ago, but it was broken and
hard to fix, maybe I can buy another one for myself. The price is within 300
yuan, can accept, Yes it was good I like it. I buy my birthday gift for myself,
even Tiger has promise to pay later.

The day was Sunday, for sure my family was all in Pan
Shan for weekend, because of my birthday, so my daughter was also coming for
the celebration, her gift for me was a dark red skirt with pockets, she knew
what I like. My nephew was the same day of birthday with me, so every year of
day we have the meal together with his family for the celebration. I was so
happy when the candle was lighting and all of family people were singing birthday
song to both of us.

After back to home after the big lunch, other surprise
to me, a fresh flower Lilies and Roses, Tiger bought the flower for me on the
way home, He was not a romance guy, but today I just tell you here today, he is
the one, I love you Tiger. I love you my daughter, I was so spoiled by my
family, right?
