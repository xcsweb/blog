At the beginning of this year, I look back
what new year resolutions I’ve made for 2018. And unfortunately, all of my
resolutions have been achieved. Yes, you got me right here that I said in 2018,
I achieved all of my resolutions and yes, I said it was unfortunately. You see,
new year resolutions are made to break, right? So how many friends I am going
to lose now? 

 

I learn, I read, I write, I walk 10,000
steps each and every day. Last year, I even managed to achieve the most
difficult two items, one, to exercise regularly, God knows how I hate to do
sports, but check my Keep record and you know my word is my bond, literally.
And the other one, to make new friends—it’s not easy for a person like me, I
was doomed to fail this one, but I joinned an online English corner and met a bunch of friends there--online friends are still friends, so you see, mission
completed. 

 

Back at the time when I made these
resolutions. It was still at the end of 2017. With expectation for a brand-new
year, I had no idea what’s waiting for me ahead. I didn’t know my husband would
get ill and lose his job. I didn’t know that I would have some issues with my
own health. I didn’t know there would be a dramatic change in my job, one of my
boss would be transferred, and another would leave the company, which means
there would be a tons of adjustments, which means under such a critical
situation, I have to keep my job, with a little too many days off—because I had
to pay many visits to the hospital—certainly it’s not good when you were
between the bosses. And I didn’t know it would be so damn hard to choose a
middle school for my son. I knew it would not be easy, I just didn’t expect
that it would be that difficult. 

 

Pressures kept mountain up. So, now you
know my secret to achieve the unachievable. I guess different people have
different ways of dealing with pressures. For me, when everything went out the
control, I was desperately to catch something still in my control. ---It’s not
much, but New year resolution is one of them, so I take at it and grasp it. 

 

And no matter what, it feels good. Okay, I
take my word-unfortunately back. I’m glad I’ve made it. New year resolutions,
or any resolutions, are not something out of your reach, you know, on the
contrary, they are so within your reach. To fail or to achieve, it’s totally up
to you. 

 

In 2019, I will keep at what I’m doing. At
the same time, I need to slow down a little bit. New life comes from a new mind
and a new way of looking at your life. There is a better version of us around
the corner, and we need to find them.
