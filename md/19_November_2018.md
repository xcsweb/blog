Soon after I left school for home when I heard my phone ringing. It was a call from son. He told me he had given me a call a short time before but I had failed to receive it. Except on my journey, I don’t carry the phone at home and school. So some calls can be missed. Later once I found these failed calls from acquaintances or family members, I would ring them back in time. He told me Northeast Electricity Company offered him a job which he may take up after graduation the coming year. If he would accept, he should sign some sort of unrepentant agreement. Afterwards he signed it as I wished.
