I've known our school's night watchman, Mr. Liu, is a good cook. I wasnâ€™t aware of his craftsmanship until yesterday when I saw him finish weaving a delicate wicker basket. People of the older generations were or are usually skilled at some vocation, for example, grandfather and father in bricklaying, uncle and brother in carpentry and mother in weaving. Now we can afford to hire craftsmen furnishing our rooms and purchase many articles of daily use. But if we do some work and make something ourselves, then we have a close connection with the work and the object. Moreover, we'll have a sense of our own importance and achievement.
