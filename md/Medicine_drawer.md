Every family has the first-aid kit or medicine
box just in case if something happened urgently, we can help ourselves before
go to see the doctor or the hospital. There are two medicine drawers at my home;
one is for Tiger which has three or four kinds of medicines only on daily
basis, due to he has the high blood pressure and terrible heart disease. I
cannot image if he suddenly fell ill by heart attack, it would be very dangerous
for his live. So for him no matter where we go, packing medicine is a very
important issue, and not one to be taken lightly.

According to the currently policy of employee,
almost 80-90% expense paid by insurance company for ordinary citizen for a year.
My previous company is not bad for the staff benefits. Luckily each of employee
are entitle to have the second reimbursement of medicine expense after paid by the
insurance, that meaning I can reimburse basic on your actual payment. What I am
trying to say is I almost have nothing expense for a year unless some special
cases. Tigerâ€™s company is the private company; it does not have such good welfare
for the staff. So all the expenses of Tiger is under my name, this is not
cheating, many of couple doing like it, due to the doctors who never care who
is the patient or not, as long as getting the medicine from their hospital or
getting the commission.

I regularly get the medicines from the small community
clinic near my home; the doctor is only responsible for making a prescription.
I prefer to prepare some basic medicines. 

Medicine drawer has to be clear up often, most
of the medicines were only one or two years expired. Yesterday I made up the
medicine drawers to prepare some for my next traveling and also clear up stacks
of pills expired. So I can say who is diligent or not at home, you can check
their medicine drawer. This is easily taken out by the date.
