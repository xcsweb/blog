The rain started this afternoon and now it seems getting heavy. This is to end the smog for the time being and another round of temperature reduction soon comes after the rain. It could be the gift for the beginning of December. It washes out the dust and brightens everything. How fast it is. December reminds me of the new year 2019 which is about to arrive around the corner. Everything looks like extraordinarily normal. But there are still something we have to be ready. One of the most important things is to plan for the new year. The second one is to conclude what exactly we have done this year. If not, we just live everyday hit or miss. Everyday in the morning, I wake up from the twitter of the birds. They always sing happily. The noisy world is none of their business. It could be that simple. In the rain, they are hilariously holding a concert. I do not know where they hide in those trees but the singing tells me of their existence.
