I walked down this road for seven years when I made the decision. However, when I looked back of what IÂ  had accomplished, it is little. To reach the destination, I still have a long way to go. For one hand, I am preparing and planning. For the other hand, I am worrying and wasting(time). I really don't know what's the best way to go, and too many things needed to be done. I must change myself, and make use of every moment. First, I need to list task of everyday, and finish the important ones. I must use time properly and make sure, I am growing or getting closer to my goals. Second, I must face the environment, the people, the workmates or boss, to see what they are doing, and why they do it this way? To find someone as your model, learn them and start your own field. Dear you, I haven't written letters to you for a long time. It does not mean I have forgotten you.
