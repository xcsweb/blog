In one week, the Spring Festival is coming. Some guys have already gone back home and some are on the way home. Fewer and fewer passenagers are found on the subway and bus, the city is getting quiet agian.When I look back, time does change me something when I am getting on. That is something like the trace left on the road and I can hardly wipe out since it happened and the memory left in mind.We are not a kid anymore. That means we have to be accountable and reasonable. Sometimes we may recall what a wonderful age we had in the childhood. It never comes back. Now we are facing many things, meanwhile we realise life is not that easy, we still have to move on. Time never tells us of the value of life. We have to discover it by observation. Probably, an unexpected experience can just be another start of life journey.There are must be something we have done and some other else we do not perfectly fulfill well. Accept what we have and do what we like. The short life does not allow us to waste too much time. I hope everything will be fine in the year of pig.
