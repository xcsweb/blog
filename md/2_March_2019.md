It is true that the golden cup and the
silver cup are not as popular as the public praise. Bai Fangli had moved the
whole China but could hardly touch the jury of Affecting China until six years
after his death. At the time when Bai donated a large sum to education
supporting the poverty-stricken students, the government had denied the existence of poor students for they had been under aid of the so-called relief fund. So the jury
had to take the same stand with the authorities on this issue. They thought Bai
had brought shame to the government. The winners must conform to the politically
motivated standard of the judging committee. Â
