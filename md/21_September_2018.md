Rainy, first at school, later at home. The rain should have poured down in this season. 
Mother urged me to send the trousers to brother, after shortening their legs as he had asked yesterday. Outside, the darkened menacing sky predicted the approaching of a shower and making the nightfall come in advance. Soon a heavy rain came down. I didnâ€™t start off until some time after the end of the sharp shower. The lane behind brother's house had turned into a stream which I have to wade across. As a result, both my shoes and socks had got wet through.
