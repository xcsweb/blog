here are many kinds of smiling in our life. Produce a
force smile sometime the people has to do it when they have heavily in debt. Or
sometime in the class, the group of students laugh at the new comer of the
picky name. What I am talking about is a sincere smile.

The people smile from the bottom of heart is sincere
smile, you can see from their faces and body language, everywhere is simple and
happiness to tell. For example, a mother is breathing her baby on her arm, a warm
and charming moment of her is the greatest smile in the world. The manager gives
the encouragement to the employee after finishing the project; the smile is
with the fully trust and reliable. Obama’s speech “Yes, We can” which smile was
giving the people more desire and confidence. 

Let me sharing a sincere smile of mine. I have married
more than 20 years. Simple wedding without any couple picture photos, which I
was so a pity till 10 years anniversary of wedding. I decided to the photo studio
to make up the wedding photo we missed. On the day we planned, three of us went
to there on time, I was following to wear white long dress and some accessories
which I loved to take at the long time ago, My dream was realized and coming
true, when we took the couple pictures with Tiger, all smiles were appearing
happiness, even taken more than hours, I was still in full of energy to
cooperate with camera operator, surely it did not have any artificially smiles
like other couples does.

Yesterday was the sunny day. It was golden opportunity
in winter to take a walk with Tiger in the park, Tiger said my smile face liked
I had at 10 anniversary wedding photos which was sincere and happy, Yes it was
I agreed, I am cherish chatting and talking each other and forgot the time.
