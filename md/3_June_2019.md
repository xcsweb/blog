Some of the Bhutanese habits are quite similar
to the Chinese ones, for example, they also like eating dumplings and love chilies
especially. 

不丹的一些习惯和中国很像，比如他们也喜欢吃饺子，尤其爱辣椒。

 Contrary to the Chinese idea of male superiority,
females are worth more than males in Bhutan for women can inherit most of the
property of their families and men only a little.

但他们的社会是“女尊男卑”型，女子会继承家里的大半产业，男子只会得到一点，这和中国的社会思想习惯有所不同。The most interesting thing here is that women
take husbands, i.e. all married men are live-in sons-in-law.

最有趣的是，这里的女子是要“娶”男人的，也就是说所有男人结婚都是“倒插门”。As long as her husband agrees, a woman can take
several more. 

女人还可以同时嫁给多个男人，但是要丈夫同意的情况下。
