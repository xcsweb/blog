Suddenly fell ill. Had no appetite at
lunch. Ate no supper. Lay on the kang covered with the thick quilt but still
felt cold. Thought I must have caught cold. Couldn’t continue to sort out the
clutter in the yard. Only drank hot water without taking any medicine. To my
great relief the fever got over towards dusk. Forced myself to light the stove
and heat the supper for mother. Early in the evening felt uncomfortable in the
stomach and it seemed a terrible stomachache was approaching. Found out the Oral
Liquid of Agastache for Dispelling Turbidity purchased before and took a tube
of it.
