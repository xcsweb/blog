I found I can't upload any pictures in the blog anymore.  When I click the order of add image I can't upload a picture and can't select the picture of my album. There are no further order or any messages. I have tried it in both my office computer and my private computer, the conditions were same.Do you have the same issue with me .  Is that the problem of my computer or the web.  And If there are administrator who can help to solve the issue.Sometimes I want to add some picture in the blog or my albums.
