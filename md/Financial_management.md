I am not good at my money management even I was an
accountant in my life, Most of money in my family was controlled and conducting
by Tiger, that’s why sometime he is complain me only focus on accommodation,
nothing else. Yes I am not a scheming woman, very simple and fully trust on
Tiger whatever he did in my life on money management. After buying the office
which is quite big issue in this year, Room rental in quarterly is quite big
amount to be flowing deposit on my account, so I have to think about how to
manage the money regularly. 

There is a MinShen Bank in our community; the service
in this bank is different with other banks I have seen before, no counter, just
like a home, to treat the people as one would treat your family, two staff like
your assistant, whatever you asked they always give your answers beyond your
expectation. they are wearing the uniform which is more elegant , not only give
you're the idea how to manage your money efficiency and also to tell how to use
Bank App freely in details instead of lining up in the other bank for doing
some pennies.

I was told every Friday morning at 9 am, the financing
products will be released on time by the central bank, one of staff would like
told me the information one day early in wechat, let me have the good
preparation to catch up the product, for instance, what’s the name, the interest
and the period of product, all the information has to know before purchase,
other wise you will be late and out of sell in one or two minutes.

The last week I was waiting to buy the one product before
five minutes early on my cell phone, unfortunately, I was missing the chance
just one or two minutes, due to I did not know the purchasing in 10 thousands
accumulate only, after I corrected the amount and retyping the word, there was
no balance left for it just in one minute. The staff was encourage me and let
me put the money into the temporary account first till the next week coming. 

This week I have learned the lesson I was ready to
purchase again before the product releasing. The time I was doing smoothly and I
made it. Very interesting for playing the money like game, I learned how to manage
my money and I will continently play my money in the future.
