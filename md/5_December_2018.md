Q4: With so long a vacation, you teachers should have nothing to complain about.
A: This can be viewed in two ways. On the one hand, the parents should thank the holidays, otherwise their children might become illiterates, because few teachers would go on their work with the holiday cancelled; on the other, would the children go to school without holidays? Would the parents let their children attend classes for twelve years running without a day's rest?
Q5: Some people on other jobs say you teachers are more comfortable than them who must work eight hours a day for giving only a few classes each week.
A: Do they think so? Do they know we must prepare lessons before giving and correct the students’ papers after class and how long it takes us to correct all the papers of more than one hundred students of two classes? Do they know we have to supervise the students' self-study in early morning and evening? Would it do for the students to do exercises and dine and maintain discipline and sanitation without any teacher keeping an eye on them?
