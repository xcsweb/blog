It was quite by accident that the plastic
basket I carried bumped against the rim of the wing mirror of the white car
parked by the roadside that day when I walked back to the bungalow with son. I thought
son had been keeping so close to me on our way that I had to give him room but
ignored the car beside us. We continued our way for a few steps when the driver
alighted blaming me mildly for my carelessness while checking over the mirror with
entire attention. I stopped immediately and retreated to him making a humble
apology. Then I expressed my willingness to compensate him for the scratch left.
He let me go after receiving Â¥100.
