I like calling somebody here Tiger is nickname, Yes,
as we know Tiger is the king in the animals of the world, not only he is the
master of the house and also he can lead his company from weakness to strength
in 10 years only. He is my Tiger my sweet heart.

Since the year 2008 coincident meeting, he left the
state – own enterprise GM position determinedly; He made the decision with his
brother to open their own property company. At the beginning there were only 20
more employees till now it has developed more than one thousand staffs on board
officially. They have gone through all kinds of hardship and difficulties, the
bottleneck period made bring them more strongly and rich experience. On the
contrary, they are cheering what they had and it must be taken for start a
business.

At the end of this year, everything of the company is smoothly
and growing up. Tiger had a very peaceful decision, He wanted to resign the
chairman of board position, remain more chances for youth and others, maybe his
health is not good enough, he wants to relax and retire early, go out with me
for travelling, and in fact we did lot outings in the past few years. His office
with full of antique furniture was left to others, He likes a small white collar
staff moving his computer to home quietly.

Yesterday was the day of Winter festival, as Chinese tradition,
every families has the dumpling at the home, on the dinner table, we had the
chat happily and freely, talking about the resignation, Tiger said to us
deeply, Have you heard a poem “再别康桥”. This poem is so match with my mood
to the company.

Very quietly I take my leave

As quietly as I came here

Quietly I wave good-bye
