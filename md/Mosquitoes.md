Everywhere is filled up with mosquitoes involving dormetory&apos;s room,class room and selfstudy room, despite time has already past the mid-autumn festival. i got 7bites on my left ankle yesterday evening in the selfstudy room and i was in long trousers! That&apos;s iching untill now. What&apos;s more, i am listening to annoying slight noise inside the mosquito bed net made by wings at the very present time.Oh my dear god, who can solve this problem?<div>&#xA0; &#xA0; This summer when I was in London, there is no such insect anywhere. I don&apos;t want to be crude but why can&apos;t we kill this species of pests and watch it die out with cheers!!!</div>
