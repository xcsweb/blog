It is strange that a heavy snow that should
have fallen in winter came down at present. This must have puzzled the newly
sprouted weeds. Although it causes inconvenience to the travelers, it must
bring a pleasant relief to the thirsty fields. In such circumstances, we
usually are informed to stay at home and exempt from work. But this time we
failed to obtain the favor. Moreover the bus, which I had planned to take to
work, was suspended for the bad road conditions. Finally I had to cycle to
school against wind and snowflakes which struck my narrowed eyes continuously.Â
