Considering those
base persons only seeking after comforts as the mole crickets and ants, why do I envy
the large whales for their moving about freely and quickly in the sea?

顧惟螻蟻輩，但自求其穴。

胡為慕大鯨，輒拟偃溟渤。My living has been
greatly undermined because of my adhering to my ideal and being ashamed of
making up to the bigwigs. It does not matter to me living in poverty at present.
But how can I put up with my talents being neglected?以兹誤生理，獨耻事干謁。



兀兀遂至今，忍為塵埃没。
