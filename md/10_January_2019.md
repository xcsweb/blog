People are inclined to believe some
repeated false propaganda out of ignorance. As time passes, the truth will be
exposed. However, the public would rather be absorbed in fictions than pursue
the facts. Some historic dramas and novels have distorted facts for personal or
political reasons. Therefore, lots of historic truth has been concealed for so
long. Some figures have been defamed and some deified, which has prevented
modern people from forming right opinions about those personages. So historic
dramas and novels have deceived audiences and readers while they give people an
enjoyable entertainment. Even people of higher education can hardly avoid the
deception.
