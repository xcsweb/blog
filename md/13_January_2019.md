Miss Yue - Sai Kan's mother's views on success Whether or not a man has achieved success can
be judged from three aspects in his last twenty years in the world. First, if
he possesses enough wealth; second, if he is healthy; third, if he has
relatives and friends by his side whom he likes and who like him. If his answers
to the three questions are in the affirmative, he can be called a successful
man. 



Born in Guilin, Guangxi, Kan yuesai went to
settle in Hong Kong with her parents at the age of three, going to study in the
US by herself at sixteen.
