the hill of shoes at home, I must say I have to clear up the shoe which I have
fed it up to my head. I told my daughter many times, please don&#x2019;t buy too many
shoe, some of them in one style just in different color, we don&#x2019;t have enough
space for your babies, my dear baby. I don&#x2019;t understand such her age girl
addition shoe so much, thousand shoe including high heeled shoes, sport shoe,
knee boot and short boot, even some of them are still new with the sticker,
nonmoving item put into corner for long time. Even She and I have the same
size, only a few of pair I can wear it. </font></span></span></p>

shoes, maybe that was my fault for terrible education since beginning. One day
I talked to my daughter seriously, we have to think about how to make it up, I cannot
suffer such mess in our home. I was determined to look the shoe shelf or cabinet
on the internet, I was going to put it into the third floor of Pan Shan home,
even I said before I hate to say the home is the storeroom, but where I can put
it? Throw away? Donate? Second hand selling? No matter how? I have to find the
place first.</font></span></span></p>

to PanShan by myself, starting at 7.30 am to install the box following the
instruction step by step. My breakfast is normally after 8.30am, so too early I
did not want to eat anything in front of such big headache, I have to work like
a horse, I am not smart on fix such man thing even there was a paper telling me
the procedure, after one or two hours, please the picture, the shoe box was
build up. And then I was starting put the shoes one by one into the boxes, I
realized there were about 120 piece more till 1.30am, it took me about six
hours, unbelievable it was done by myself! I forgot the time, I can not stand
up with my terrible waist.</font></span></span></p>
