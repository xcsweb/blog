There are four colleagues from Brazil site in our office these
days.  It’s not a common thing for us sit
in the same office with foreigners athough there are not any work connection with
us. The official language of them is portuguese. One of them have been studied
in Wuhan before and his girlfriend is a Chinese, So his oral chinese is
excellent for common communication. The leader of them fuently in English. And
the others just know a little english. Two of them are European-brazilians,
besides one Afrian-brazilian and one Indian-brazilian. The ethnic composition
is complex for us.

We are interested with them and want to talk with them, but we are
nervous to do that. Tody I talk with them for a while. I give them some tea and
they give me two bags of coffee in return. And we talk about how to make tea
and coffee. There are some difficults for us to talk in English because my
English is not so good. The nervous is a problem too, maybe I’ll do better
without that. 

Maybe we’ll have further communication in the later days. That’s a
good beginning to open my month.
