My uncle and his big family were waiting us at the
entrance to the village, greeting and laughing were breaking the quiet village,
and the dog was barking which was to welcome our coming. 

There was a big courtyard with steel gate, I have
never seen such big courtyard before, it can be parking four or five cars at
least, I was told the house is about 300 square meters with 6 living rooms, one
study room and laundry room, there are three bath rooms, it was build for two
years including digging the foundation, I like sunshine so much, so there are
four living rooms are at the south, you can enjoy the sunlight totally in the
room. Some furniture is still on the way, and paper wall is not ready yet, but
I like the sliding door at the kitchen and toilet, which are so easy to push
and pull.

I paid more attention on the detail of the decoration,
the different colour in different room, one room is in pink, one is in green
and other one in light blue, like curtain, bedding article and some small goods
on the shelf are so match in one room, I was told it was doing by daughter in
law who is from the countryside as well, I asked her she must be taken a lot of
time for the design and arrangement, it was really not easy for her, due to her
husband was not around there during this two years of self-building, I cannot
accept such big burden trouble without hermy husband. So we cannot look down any
person who comes from city or countryside, anyone can be the great around you;
just you don’t know who is super or genies.

Many of relatives were around us; I was holding my
mother to enter the room slowly. This was a really big party, and I had no time
to take videos and photos for the moment, so pity to miss the change to record,
only had some taken by others. To be continue.
