In actual life and on TV sometimes we get
to know some handicapped people achieving great success which is hard to attain
for many of the healthy. Everyone has unlimited potential in some aspect. But it
lies dormant in most people. Only those with stubborn determination can fully
or partly realize their potential. Some of the handicapped can hardly put up with
being looked down upon. They rise up to fight against the social prejudices with
their achievements as weapons. They earn the dignity they deserve. So we may
say that unluckiness can become a motive force to move forward.
