On Spring Festival I returned to my native
village Yuzhuang in central Shandong.

春节，我回到故乡于庄——一个山东鲁中地区的小村，

The region is famous for being the Home of Confucius
and Mencius and the Land of Ceremony and Propriety.

这里以“孔孟之乡、礼仪之邦”著称，

Tradition says that this is the birthplace of Liuxia
Hui, Saint of Harmony, who resuscitated a woman who had almost frozen stiff in
his arms without abusing her.

相传是坐怀不乱的和圣柳下惠故里，

The local people still perform the prostration
ceremony during Spring Festival.

这里春节还流行着磕头跪拜大礼，

The family members are seated according to the
order of seniority when dining.

这里吃饭讲究座次分明、尊卑有序——

The women here are deprived of the right at the
dinner table accordingly. 

自然，这里的女人吃饭不上桌。
