That day I happened to find a new hole in one of the plastic woven sacks I use to contain the recyclable picked. The hole was wide enough to let an egg in. I thought it must be gnawed through by a rat. A large simulated corn-cob was just printed there, which the rat probably had mistaken for a true one. I could not help recalling an interesting anecdote many years ago. One of the little geese mother raised came over to me trying to bite the lower edge of my green jacket as a leaf. Not only the animals make such mistakes, but we people sometimes do the same without realizing it.
