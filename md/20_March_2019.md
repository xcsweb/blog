I didn’t know we’re off today until I cycled
to the locked gate of our school. I made sure of the fact before leaving for
home by inquiring of our principal. I only learnt that the Central School in
our town has closed since yesterday afternoon for the bad conditions of the
snow-covered
roads. This morning the icy roads became dangerous to all the vehicle drivers. Yesterday
I retreated from school early and this morning I found no information about the
closure of school in the communication space of the staff on the phone. Next time
under such circumstances I must phone our principal first before setting out.
