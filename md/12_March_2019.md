A true healthy person has a sound mind and
body. Most people only pay attention to their physical health but overlook the mental
health. They try to strengthen their bodies by taking different exercises and eating
various nutritious foods. But few of them can keep fit because they often
suffer from suspense, depression and anxiety. I think we can find a good answer
from the nature and the animal world. The Buddhists have benefitted a lot from
natural laws. We see the wild animals live simply and well, quite different
from the complicated human world. We can also draw some inspiration from the
way of life taken by the long‐lived people in the remote areas.
