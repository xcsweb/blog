People are fascinated by the mysteries easily, wandering about the men, the women,themselves and the nature. To uncover or not, it really annoys us; to accept or not, it is really a different decision to make when it gets unveiled.Sometimes I was in my feelings that day about that particular situations, good or bad times. I got the good side of you, as well as the bad side of you. I realize, I haven’t completely forgot about you; I apologize, I wish that this wasn’t the way things were going down. I have seen all these amazing places and been through all these crazy experiences. I got the good side of life, so many thoughts I want to share, I hope you can understand.Cover or uncover, depending on our hearts. For me, I am always on the road of healing, and am always to be a healer for myself or others. Everything is a mirror for your own internal state. Just let it be. No matter whom I meet, he is the person in my life.
