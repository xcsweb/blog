A biography
of the writing brush

毛颖传

The
writing brush came from Zhongshan. Owing to the great service when helping the Great
Yu administer the east and foster the living beings, its ancestor the hare had
been conferred upon the title of lord of the fief at Mao region, becoming one
of the twelve gods of corresponding symbolic animals after death.

毛颖者，中山人也。其先明眎，佐禹治东方土，养万物有功，因封於卯地，死为十二神。It had ever said, “My descendants, as the offspring of a god, should
be quite different from other living things for they will be born of the mouth.” Later this came true indeed.  

尝曰：“吾子孙神明之後，不可与物同，当吐而生。”已而果然。
