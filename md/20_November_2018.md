Transported back the firewood and coal collected at school. The firewood is the young elms felled last spring, which has been dry. Recently I have been thinking carry it home at the weekend with the coal flour with brother's trike. But it occurred to me in the afternoon to take it back with brother's van immediately when I found the wood was too much. I phoned the idea to him. He hesitated at first and tried to delay his help to another day. When I told him I had moved the wood to the gate and trimmed it as he demanded, he reluctantly agreed.
