Some of the garbage cans along the road I pass have been changed for new ones. They are quite different from the old ones. The new is longer but lower, a storage tank in miniature. It is enclosed with lids that can be closed and opened freely. Most of its exterior is white and blue close to the bottom. The old is blue and cuboid with its top left open. Several days ago two concrete bases were built just outside the southwest corner of the slaughterhouse near our bungalow. Today two new dustbins were placed on them,Â  and each with four wheels at the bottom. I wonder if they can be emptied by the forklift as before.
