Your departure brings separation between us.

行行重行行，與君生别離。
Then we're over ten thousand li
apart.

相去萬餘里，各在天一涯。
How can we know when to meet again under such
circumstances？  

道路阻且長，會面安可知？

The northern horse likes the north wind; the
southern bird tends to nest on the branch facing south.

胡馬依北風，越鳥巢南枝。
