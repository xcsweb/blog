Both the cuffs of the locals and the front
parts of the men's robes are often used as bags bulging with things.

当地人的袖口和男子的衣服前襟都是当做口袋用的好地方，经常鼓鼓囊囊放满了东西。The Bhutanese are naturally and gracefully attired
in traditional costumes indicating their spiritual pursuit to a certain extent.
They stand aloof from the worldly strife and lead a leisurely and carefree
life. 

不丹的传统服饰飘逸潇洒，从一定程度上表现了他们的精神追求，他们过着与世无争、悠然自得的生活。The Bhutanese believe in Buddhism. People don’t
lock doors mostly when leaving home for the good public order and the simplicity
and honesty of the folkway. 

不丹人信佛，社会治安良好，民风淳朴，人们出门都不怎么锁门。
