    Last weekend, my wife went back her hometown with my little son, suddenly, the whole apartment became so quiet during the past days even made me uncomfortable without my little son's noise. When my little son was at home, I hardly enjoyed a quiet environment because he always pestered you playing games or taking him outside for funny, I can just have a short break while he was sleeping. The little boy seemed like having an endless of energy and he can keep an ability of moving from one place to another place without tiredness. What's more, he always easy attracted by something around him and easy distracted by something else. Sometimes, he was so naughty that I had to teach him a lesson as punishment, at that moment, he can realize mistakes he did, but, normally, he will quickly forget it no more five minutes, and the same mistakes may re-occur in a few days. It is the nature of children which don't to hide their true thoughts and show their true colors to people around them. For these preschoolers, most of times, they are simulating actions of adults from their parents.\    Anyway, hopefully wish my wife and my little son can have a pretty good vacation in my mother-in-law home.
