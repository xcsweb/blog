One month later, the Spring Festival is coming. As always, before the end of lunar year 2018, there are still many things to deal with on work. Meanwhile many guys are busy booking tickets for going back home in Spring Festival. Even though I have set up the alarm clock on my cellphone, it is sort of hard for getting up in the morning when the phone rings at 6 am., since the warm bed which looks like a giant magnet firmly drags me back. Unconditionally, like ohters, I fancy for the warmth of bed. I have to take this challenge if I do not get up in time I will be late. After countdown by three, two, one, I get up.This rainy winter really makes people easier into depression. Only few sunny days came out, most of the time, it rains and had already snowed twice. It is tremendously uneasy under the high humidity weather for a very long time.There is no idea to predict when it is going to be sunny. Whatever, we have to wait and go through this winter. God knows what will happen next.
