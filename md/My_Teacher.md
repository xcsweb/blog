The most unforgotten person of me is my
high school chemistry teacher. I never forget the method which he told when I
confuse to a problem. He told my how to solve chemical problem and how to think
the problem in the world. 

 

When I enter the high school, I have a poor
performance in my study. My parents feel nerves ,but I can’t improve it.
Gradually I began to hate study. I slept in the class, copy class mate’s
homework. Unfortunately I failed my chemistry. After this exam, he had a talk
with me. I told him, I don’t know how to study, and maybe study is a bad choice
for me. He said “No, no, no you just need to think more ,think more, ……you will
be the best student of me” . The talk touched me a lot. After that I have more
patience in thinking, though maybe low efficient. He also told the way to solve
chemical problem. 

The same time, I became interested in
social problems. Sometimes, I will be upset because I can’t change the world
and solve these problems. I attempt to talk with somebody. But no one can I
talk. Finally, I told my confusion to him. He tell my a lot. He tell I should
think more.

Just these two words, these change me a lot.
It help me learning, and tell me how to think the social problems. I won’t
forget it, I won’t forget my chemistry teacher.
