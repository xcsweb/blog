This trip to Shan Xi is not only for the wedding ceremony,
but also we would like go somewhere for travelling as well, Yan An is belong to
Shan Xi 陕西province
just across Yellow river in other side of Shi Lou county, it will take two hours
by car to be there we were told. Yan An is the old revolutionary base area. I
have been to some red areas in China with my previous company before, but YanAn
I haven’t been to yet, and there is a very famous pagoda to be the symbol of
the place, I really want to take the picture in there.

After wedding, the bridegroom’s brother was so kind
and he would like to be our guide to YanAn by car, due to he knew the way of
the destination and it was much easy for the stranger without any direction
except GPS to be helped. The traffic was not smoothly as we expected, the road
was fully occupied by many big trucks on the way, so we almost took about three
or four hours to be there, we first found the motel near the base, and ready to
visit at the next morning.

The famous pagoda has been showed in front of us at
the sunny day, it is totally nine floors with 44 meters height, unfortunately
it was repaired recently, that’s why we did not go upstairs. There are not so
many people in the park at the early morning, so we walked around slowly to
taste the feeling there, a big party flag came into my eyes under the pagoda. There
was a board with some words of Party statement, I am so proud to be a party
member. Just by the chance I was trying to raise my hand and reading the word
by word loudly to swear again. I knew Tiger had taken the photos and videos to
record for the golden moment as well. How wonderful time I had! It was a
meaningful trip to Shan Xi.
