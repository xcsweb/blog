Under the temptation of a sharp rise of
temperature the other day, the willow twigs got green quickly and the old
poplars were all in bloom; the weeds at the roadsides wildly spread. Strong winds
blew on and on for days. Cycling in the side wind, I had to incline my upper
body towards the direction from which the wind came. Yesterday the temperature
suddenly dropped to a few degrees above zero from twenty-odd degrees with a shower
in the high wind. The rain beat against the window-panes and left dirty marks on
the exterior. The western-style jacket wouldn’t do any more in such weather for it's open at the bosom.
I put on another one in addition which can zip up at the front to keep warm.
