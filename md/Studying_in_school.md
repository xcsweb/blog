    I recently struggle for if I need to sign up a cram school for my daughter, because my wife and I will be busy in the following two months that we can't totally cover her learning condition. Now, she is in sixth grade, it is the critical moment for her and it will depend on if she can enter into a good middle school. We asked my daughter if she would like to go cram school for studying improvement. But, she refused to go cram school and she said that she could remain current learning level without extra tutoring. In response to this, I promised her if she keeps enough self-discipline in learning, she will not be sent to cram school and test scores will be as examination standard at the end of this semester.    Mostly, as parents always have the worries about their kids' learning in school, especially, at the stage of middle school because it will greatly affect if they have opportunity entering into what kind of high schools, if they fail to access competitive high schools.How to mention the future in the rest of their lives without prospective career and keep a relatively decent life--
