We were going to stay in the capital of Cambodia Phnom
Penh for four or five days. There was only 40 minutes by air from Westport to
here, it was very convenience compare with two years ago that taken 5 hours by
car.  Anita’s driver picked us up in the
airport on time.

Anita was kindly inviting us to live her apartment
again, the same as two years ago I came here with my friend Marry Liu, this
time it was same I live in one bed with Anita, we can have whisper chatting
till midnight, so privacy, It was so weird both were lying at two edge of bed
when we slept, surely we are not Lesbian, and otherwise it wouldn’t like that. Haha.
The location of her apartment is very good near Mekong River, very nice view at
the roof platform, many pictures we took at there, the coffee and tea are all
free at the lounge, surely free wi-fi as well, and there is the swimming pool,
fitness centre at the first flood.

The safety of street at Cambodia is not good enough at
the moment, there are some grabbing bags can be happened at anywhere and any
moments in the public, so avoid going out for dinner, Anita took away for her canteen
foods for us during the working day, the cashew nut which was making by her
staff, there is one machine for baking it only, unbeliever it was so big and
still hot when we took it. 

This time we came to Cambodia, one of reason was to visit
an officer who worked in the local government, to see whether he can introduce some
projects or using the relationship to find the opportunities of business. But surprise
we were told that don’t pull any relationships with them, it was very corrupt
officials here ever worse than our cities in China, if you would invite them to
have a dinner together or some events to let them to come, you might has to pay
appearance fee first, sounds  ridiculous!
Well enough the guy accepted Tiger’s invitation to meet at our apartment for
coffee only in the lounge, Surely China Wine to be the gift send to him to show
our respect, he was very happy to welcome our coming.

This was another nice trip again to Cambodia, Anita
asked for the hug before we left, I knew she will miss me and the same I will
miss her not less than her, I will be always waiting her at somewhere in the
earth to have our own privacy talking.
