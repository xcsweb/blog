Z and Y sisters are herdswomen from Y Township, L County, S City, Tibet Autonomous Region. Since the 1960s, under the influence and direction of their father S, they have held a firm belief that Y is their home, China their country, and herding sheep and cattle their duty while guarding the national border. They have been consistently patrolling along the boundary and defending thousands of square kilometers of the frontier territory of our country for several decades and should attain the stature of praiseworthy patriots of the present era.
