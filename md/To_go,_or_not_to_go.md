To go: &nbsp;it's always my dream to have a full play of my English. The fewer chance I've got now to practice it, the more eager I want to keep it fresh. I don't want it die in the pale daily routine. I'm really interested in that job. It's a precious chance.<div>&nbsp;Not to go: my main task now is to have a baby-- to get pregnant. I am planning to try to get it before the new semester starts. So beforehand I should get healthy and fit.</div>
