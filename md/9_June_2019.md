All the year round
I'm concerned about the life of the
civilians. Thinking of their misery, I can't help sighing and being anxious for them.


窮年憂黎元，嘆息膓内熱。

Regardless of the
mockery of my fellows, I'll make further
efforts singing heartily.

取笑同學翁，浩歌彌激烈。I could not have avoided the temptation
to withdraw from society and live freely in solitude.非無江海志，瀟洒送日月。       Lucky to be under the reign of such a
sagacious emperor like Yao
and Shun, how can I have the heart to leave His Majesty forever without contributing
my share?生逢尭舜君，不忍便永訣。In the court today there is an abundance
of talent, and how can I be needed in the construction of the state？

當今廊廟具，構厦豈云缺。

Just
like the sunflowers facing the sun, how can I change my loyalty to the monarchy?
 

葵藿倾太陽，物性固莫奪。
