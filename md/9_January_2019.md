This afternoon saw the old Japanese film A
Distant Cry from Spring by chance on the movie channel. The name is familiar to
me because it was one of the many films I had listened in to on the radio in
the 1980s in my teens. But its content had left on me a vague impression. The hero
dubbed into Chinese by Mr B is still melodious as before. And this was the
first time I've seen the film. The story is mediocre but the players' acting is first-rate which moved me
to tears. It is really a good film and I can't pinpoint any of our films
matching up to it.Â
