Well, first this is not a sort of blog, precisely, it is my way of thinking. Thus, I kept down, to see what it would be. After knowing this, you can go on to read. I have to say, I have a lot of negative energy, so you should be careful when you are reading.Dream is just dream, you can not take it as being real. But I can't walk myself out of it. I define my dream that is real. Okay, no matter what it is, I made my decision and made my dream. Now where am I now? It seems I didn't step out my feet, like I am walking at the begining. However, I believe that day will come and everything turns out to be fine, my endeavor won't lose in vain.I'll tell you my strategies. First learning, then working, and find all kinds of ways to earn money, when my financial situation allows, I'll go and touch my dream. Yes, so simple.
