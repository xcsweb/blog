She, a young mother from the countryside of
Shaanxi, appeared on the platform offered by the Shanghai TV station for
performances of mums. She gave the judges and audience a good surprise when she
began to sing an old folk song. She was just a chicken farmer without learning
singing specially from any teacher. But she was gifted in singing with a
sonorous voice. And singing was only one of her hobbies. She would sing loudly
to call the dispersed chickens together for feeding. What she was most proud of
was that half of the migrant workers from her village have come back to work on
her farm.
