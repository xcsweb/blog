As throngs after throngs of famers fight
their way to the towns, some far‐sighted white‐collar workers quit their well‐paying jobs in the cities retreating to the rural communities that
they have come from. Some may call them fools. But the great farming achievements
of many of these highly educated professionals have proved that their choice is
right and the talents can put their abilities to good use in the countryside
similarly. Here these modern promising recluses enjoy
a simple healthy life without working pressure, traffic jams, air pollution, cold
relations they have suffered in the cities. Above all they can take good care of their old whom many young
townspeople have ignored for being occupied in their careers.
