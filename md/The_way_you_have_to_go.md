Time does not tell of the truth it equals to everyone. Many of us just feel it is unfair that somebody can be rich and successful. Surely, something we can not change, while some other things we can find ways to take them. Hard, but it still shows that we can try. Never underestimate your power and you are potential to be a qualified warrior.The world is a magic stage. We never know its edge and limitation. It is more than we can image. Let it be, sometimes we just feel comfortable to move forward. We learn and absorb, meanwhile digest and accumulate. Never reply on some so called experience which can lead you to success in a short time. It is never going to happen.Â Life is not easy, live at present and cherish what we have. There is no such a road we can fully go through without bothering. Actually, it is full of risks and uncertainties. Why do we have to be hard on ourselves? Because sometimes we have no choices. When the burden lands on shoulders, we have to embrace and envisage it.
