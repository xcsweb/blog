Long ago I learnt that a beauty married a dwarf willingly. Now I happened to know that another pretty girl has become the wife of a man contracting cerebral palsy. Both cases seem to me inconceivable. Both women had something in common. They were against the traditional values on selecting spouses. They disregarded looks, status, family background, etc. They could have married excellent gentlemen only by their delicate features. Why not? Perhaps they have seen through the world affairs. They have realized the uncertainty of some so-called satisfactory marriages and the unreliability of those admirable husbands. Therefore they would rather be engaged to disabled men than accept a prince's hand.
