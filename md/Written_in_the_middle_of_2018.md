This is the summer of 2018, it's quite hot outside.The weather forecast claims the highest temperature will be more than 35 until next week .Last weekend, there was a typhoon crossing the north of Shanghai--Chongming island, and it blew violently and rained about two days.It was too hard to hold the umbrella in the fast wind. I almost stayed at home all day because it's scared outdoor.Thinking about the past year, it's a bit uncomfortable. I resigned from Datayun last summer, then I took a gap before attending another company.That was not a routine period, compared with workday before. I read several books in those days unemployed. From that experience, I thought a lot about life and family. It was a bit difficult to stay alone without some communication with others. Fortunately, I had two mates in the house.We insisted on communicating with each other and playing badminton regularly.I find that I have lost some memory in vocabulary, maybe I should spend more time in English.Best wishes to us~
