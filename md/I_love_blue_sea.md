I love blue sea, not only it is so wide and large, but
also it is so powerful and strong enough in anywhere, it has the different
colours in one day at different season, and it is so match with the full of
tenderness cloud in one picture. During my time in Hai Nan this time, it was
verification what I said.

Ling shui is in southeast of Hai Nan, I was the first
time to be there even I have come to Hai Nan a few times before, on my
understanding, any places near the sea must be wet and humid, washing clothe is
hard to get the dry in one day, but Ling Shui is the good place, it has the nice
view and it is not too many people, the people in the seaside is only the
residents of the community and the hotel guests. During my stays, I went to the
seaside at the early morning around 6.30am every day, I like to taste the feel
of the sea, I watched the sun rising on the horizon far away, it’s like a red
ball of fire, it makes everything around us look very beautiful, I was playing
the water and running in and out to the sea in make different poses with my
friends. We wanted to record any moments by photos and videos and it were all
arrested by our youth change future, The event picture was just directly in our
faces, we forgot the time to be there, the coastline likes a big prawn very
clearly to say hello to everyone there. I cannot control myself to recite one
poem “ Say goodbye again to Cambridge”, my friend took the record quietly at
the side. How lovely the sea and my friends! Because of you accompany with me
always, the life makes it beautiful. I love you all forever.
