Mencius once said one would survive in
adversity and die of a soft life. And there is another saying, to spoil a child
is to kill it. These contentions have proved true even today. Almost every
couple try their best to bring up their only child without grudging any time
and money. They satisfy all of the kid’s requirements as they can. The child is demanded to do nothing but
study. After the child grows up, the parents still provide for his living and
education, later pay the expenses of his marriage and the marital house, and finally
help looking after his child. He may take it for granted that he can always get
help from his parents. Once losing their support, he won’t  tackle any problems. It is his parents that have
deprived him of the chances to train himself.
