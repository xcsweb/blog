Dear Sir or Madam,

 

I’m writing this letter to express my
dissatisfaction with the terrible situation I have faced lately. I’m a resident
on Donghu Street.
I have been living there for more than ten years and enjoy my life all the
time. However, some unhappy things happened recently and have bad influence on
my life.

 

Near my house, a few restaurants have been
founded in the past few months. These restaurants offer food to the residents
nearby, but meanwhile yield a large amount of rubbish, which seriously pollutes
the living environment of ours residential districts. 

 

I understand that these people need to find
some way to make a living, but they should not damage the interests of other
people. Therefore, I hope the relevant government departments would send
someone to discuss some solutions with those people, clean up the rubbish, and
return a clean, pleasant and healthy environment to us.

 

I am looking forward to your reply.

 

Yours
sincerely,

 

Jack
