A prolonged spell of hot weather with little rain will be prevailing in our region. Today's maximum temperature reached 34Â°C. We suffered terribly from the intense heat during the day. It's really unbearable to stay at mother's bedroom. The scorching heat outside was also intolerable. In the heatwave people can easily get tired and sleepy. Seeing mother had lain down on the kang, I found a plank at the yard and took it indoors. I laid it on the floor of the corridor and covered it with a mat as a bed for taking a nap. Tomorrow 's maximum temperature is one degree higher than today 's. People have been told to prevent heatstroke and reduce the temperature where they rest.
