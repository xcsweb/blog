Today learnt another frame-up in the TV program called Observation of Morality. The rescuer of a collapsed driver should have been falsely accused of causing the trouble and sentenced to pay the plaintiff ¥200,000 odd. This case reminded me of one of Aesop's Fables, A Farmer and A Snake. I have been aware that from time to time some kind people have got into trouble for offering help. The public have taken warning from such happenings. That was why no one gave a hand to the old fallen person who hysterically asked for help in a busy street in Shijiazhuang and announced loudly she would not blackmail anyone for a long time before a few teenage students came to her help.
