He had been depending on others for a
living without getting an official position. How could he go back to face his
old country folks under such embarrassed circumstances？So he would rather spend his
final years in the boat on the southern waters than realize his home-coming. He was
really a great master of poetry but a failed husband and father. He insisted on
writing enthusiastically in spite of hardship. His achievement derives from his
great learning，insight, versatility, extensive travelling, experience of
frustrations and social intercourse. Thanks to his one thousand odd poems that remain,
his reputation will not perish as long as Chinese people exist on the earth.
