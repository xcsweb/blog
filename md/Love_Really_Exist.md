      This term, I
taught at a private school, which is dedicated in migrant workers’ children
education, as a volunteer teacher. This school is located in the suburbs of Hai
Dian district in Beijing. The head teacher of the school is a professor who
teaches in Peking University. He thinks that the children of the migrant
workers are hard to find a school, for seldom of them can get education in the
public school in Beijing. He established a school just for those pupils. This
school’s tuition fees are very low than the other same kind of the schools. The
head teacher advocated that kids here can get best education, and the tuition
fees are always cheaper than others on condition that all the money he get can
maintain the normal expenditures (including the teachers’ salaries, water and
electricity fees, etc.)

      Due to the most
migrant workers mainly do small business or work in some factories, they have
no time to teach their kids or they couldn’t teach their kids for they are
illiteracy or almost illiteracy, theirs kids seem very poor. Most of them can’t
get best education for the schools they go to are mainly private schools, in
which most of these kinds schools just earn money, seldom do they put more
money into qualified facilities related to best teachers and the basic electrical and educational equipments.
The pupils’ grades are common much lower than public schools. 

       When I taught at the school, I found that too many volunteers
donate money or computers or facilities relate to study or something like that.
Before , I just think that rich people only care about themselves, seldom do
they care about others, even if some of them do good deeds just for fame. I
read too many bad news about people who did wrong things, sometimes, I even
believe that people are born in evil! Now, I totally changed my ideas. People
who have a care heart are everywhere, they often do good things, they just make
sure that what they do just worthy.

        Love really exist, she is just there waiting us to find. And
I also make a decision that I will be a volunteer teacher at that school until it
can’t exist.搜索复制
