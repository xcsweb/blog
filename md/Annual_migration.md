      This week is the last working days before spring
festival holidays, as normal, some guys whose hometown are far away from
working place have asked for leave in advance in order to avoid rush hours on
freeway. Inevitably, no matter how many days you ask for leave ahead of
holiday, the only way which must be passed have already stuck in heavy traffic
for driving long distance back to hometown. It was really a spectacle during
the past years which there are no many means of transportations except by
ordinary train. That is also a golden age for scalpers, nowadays, as the
increasing of private car and public transportations developed in recent five
years. There are more choices for selection especially more and more people
choose to take private car as the first option, not only it is convenient for
moving for visiting relatives during holidays, but it can greatly save time
that you don’t need wasting time in the station to waiting train or bus which
could be late. But, taking private cars also has their problems that too many
cars surged through freeway during several holidays caused traffic jam, what’s
more, the terrible thing is if you are clogged in freeway that means you will
endure hunger, thirst even can’t find a place for pee. Normally, before spring
festival, the passenger flow will follow up the direction that from east and
south to west and north. After spring festival, the opposite passenger flow
will do over that really a big challenge to public transport. Anyway, each
means of transport has its advantage and disadvantage, I hope everyone can
enjoy a happy time and safely go and come.
