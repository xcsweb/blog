Today is Monday , not  well for me because too much works are waiting to be completed , it ended so quickly all perfect things seem to end !.......she always say "we"  ,I guess that  she is not alone person  in this place , there are another person or more person stay here , I did not know who is she or he or they  ? and I can imagine the seaside  on the picture which was decorated by them, and they  spent a lot of time at least one or two years , there are at least 5 kinds of flowers , the trees had been trimmed neatly ,  and the cats looks lovely and a little fat .... all of things are very  harmonious and very nice . but I saw a tear on her graceful  face . ......
