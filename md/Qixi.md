<div><font size="3"><font face="Verdana">Today is Qixi, the Chinese Valentine&apos;s Day. Some girls and ladies received flowers, something like the Western way. Some of them went out for a dinner or a movie with their boys. The romance is built on the mutual understanding and a little surprise brings happiness. It is still hot and tomorrow is the Begging of Autumn. But the hot wave does not prevent people&apos;s passion from expressing to beloved ones. This festival has its legenary story. Traditional festivals can remind us of customs and inheritance of history. It is the people&apos;s wealth. Here I wish all got happiness with his or her beloved one.<br></font></font></div>
