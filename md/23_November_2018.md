Nowadays some people raise money by degrading themselves. They seem to value cash above their dignity. It is unimpeachable to receive some gift of money at wedding or funeral. It is annoying to invite people to a charged dinner in the name of celebrating a birthday or moving into a new residence or entering a higher school. The host may justify himself declaring that he should reclaim the money he has given. I have presented cash gift for many times since I transferred to this school. I have no intention to have it returned. I won't beg money from colleagues by the shameful way used currently.
