This afternoon the Italian women's volleyball team won against the Chinese by a narrow margin. The score was 3-2. In the game we could easily find the weakness of the Chinese team. Most players are still the familiar old ones who have ever won the championship time after time. They should have retired and replaced by new young ones. No team can hold the championship forever. Two of the former strongest volleyball teams, the American and the Russian have been eliminated through the contest. And can the Chinese make an exception? We must face the cruel reality. It is inevitable that the rising force will replace the old power.
