Cervantes lived at the time when China was under the Ming dynasty. He was contemporary with Shakespeare. His representative work is Don Quixote, which is recognized as the best work in Spanish literature. He was hasty in writing and never revised his works before put to press. The popularity of Don Quixote ranks second only to the Bible. As soon as it appeared, it received a great welcome from the public. This aroused the envy and attacks of his counterparts. Although he lived in poverty all his life, he was always sanguine about the future. Up to now, no satisfactory translation of Don Quixote has been found.
