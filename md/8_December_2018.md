Fortunate to have watched The World Listens to Me this evening on the Chinese International channel. It was a program on cultural inheritance in which some successful foreign Chinese were invited to share their experiences with the audiences. As a special observer，Ms L, 92, the first Chinese on the Academy, turned up and related her eternal and legendary art life. Then came a self-called Lively Granny and the Original Curator, Lady L, a high-born restless leading artist. Next, Z, a representative from New Zealand Young Leaders Forum, told how he had been bullied at school during his first days as an emigrant and later won the respect of his schoolmates by distinguishing himself in playing basketball. Finally, Mr W, a veteran inheritor of Peking Opera, now President of Japanese Peking Opera Institute, gave a brief account of his career in Japan and his efforts in promoting the cultural exchange between China and Japan.
