     We should complete the second production line set-up
this week as plan, we are not sure whether we can go as plan based on current
process. Currently, the big problem is how to set up the electricity and
compressed air accordingly, it seems like suffering a severe problem and if it
can’t be solved by Thursday this week, that means the next step of all things
will be delayed even it is possible to put it off until the end of this new year.
If it is so, it will be the worst result that we are not to see it, the next
step the facility department will mobilize all possible resources to push the
process keeping on going as early as they can. It will be a challenge job to
them, from our side, we also hope all things can turn back to track quickly,
after all, we are expecting that it will not affect the following New Year
holidays. Because, we will spend lots of energy and time on the second
production line in evaluation and verification after it was installed. That means
we will have a tough time to focus on this new line for all kinds of issues
solved and debug on site during the next two months. As the current situation
develops, the work overtime will be inevitable in the following time and will
keep a long time. The most problem we faced with that we are always short
hands, meanwhile, the management level doesn’t like adding new hands anymore. Because
the sales will not increase next year based on current forecast, I guess that a
new wave of departure will be coming after the New Year holidays, anyway, let’s
go and see……
