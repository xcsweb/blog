Finished
reading Adam Bede yesterday. To my disappointment, its final parts end too
quickly and simply in the marriage of Adam and Dinah. I had been attracted by its
beginning parts. Dinah is my favorite character in the story. She is graceful
and popular, helpful to her aunt with housework, friendly to Lisbeth and
devoted to Methodist preaching. She seems to have an inbred sense of duty for God.
She often feels as if God was near to her. She has a great influence with the
parishioners. The perfect concord between Adam and Arthur is only an
imagination of the author.Â
