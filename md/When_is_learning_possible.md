To inquire and to learn is the function of the mind.<div>By learning I&#xA0; do not mean the mere cultivation of memory or the accumulation of knowledge,but the capacity to think clearly and sanely without illusion,to start from facts and not from beliefs and ideals.</div><div>There is no learning if thought originates from conclusions.</div><div>Merely to acquire information or knowledge is not to learn.</div><div>Learning implies the love of understanding and the love of doing a thing for itself.</div><div>Learning is possible only when there is no coercion of any kind.</div><div>And coercion takes many forms,does it not?</div><div>There is coercion through influence,through attachment or threat,through persuasive encouragement,or subtle forms of reward.</div><div>Most people think that learning is encouraged through comparison,whereas the contrary is the fact.</div><div>Comparison brings about frustration and merely encourages envy,which is called competition.</div><div>Like other forms of persuasion,comparison precents learning and breeds fear.</div>
