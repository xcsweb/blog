There seems no end of raining. And almost everyday, it keeps raining, raining and raining. Though it makes me incovenient for the outdoors workout, I sense it fine in the night that I can read quietly. Besides, I can do some push-ups and sit-ups in the bedroom. I call it the creation of circumstances so that I fine another way to continue.We can hardly do anything but complaining the bad weather. Anyway we still have to work and live. The Spring Festival ended and most guys have already gone back to work again. No matter how busy I am, I have made the decision that I need to change. Not only the quality of life but also the pursuit of life, I think I have to step out and move further. We all want to better ourselves.The drowsy sound of raindrops makes me comfortable. I sleep well when it rains in the night. Every time it is.
