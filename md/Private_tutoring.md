tutoring, here I am going to tell about student&#x2019;s tutoring.</font></span></span></p>

that private tutoring can help their kids with different subject by raising
their academic scores and improving their learning skills. Children have to
visit their teacher in their spare time, usually at weekends. But in fact,
private tutoring does not always work.</font></span></span></p>

obvious. First, some private tutors are college students, who have no teaching
experience. They are not qualified for teaching children good learning methods.
The only thing they can do is to help children finish homework. Beside, private
tutoring prevents children from learning actively. They might be less attentive
in the class, because with extra help from private tutor, children don&#x2019;t worry
about the loss in the class. The most serious disadvantage is that private
tutoring not only lays a heavy burden on the family finance, but also takes up
too much spare time of school children.</font></span></span></p>

their children&#x2019;s education, but sometimes they think little about the
effectiveness of private tutoring. Although good private tutors do help children
with their lessons, too much dependence on private tutoring should be avoided
and controlled.</font></span></span></p>

only when she faced the entrance exam, Chinese subject need to be improved. What
I am trying to say is basic on the kid needs, Study method and study interests are
most important for the students, let them have self &#x2013; awareness, to be parents
to make a good example for them,</font></span></span></p>
