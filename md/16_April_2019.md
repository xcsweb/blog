Not
only I but also all my teaching counterparts are derelict in duty and run
irrelevant business.        

我是一个‘不务正业’的老师，不只我，全天下老师都是！ 

 What is a teacher’s proper duty?

教师的正业是什么？

Presumably imparting knowledge and
educating people is what many people might say. Indeed, our annotation of teacher is a professional in charge
of teaching.

想必很多人会说是“教书育人”，确实我们对教师的诠释就是“担任教学工作的专业人员”！But actually teachers can’t attend to their proper duties because
too much of their time has been spent doing many other things, which include busily preparing for all kinds of inspections, filling in various forms and carrying out different activities, so ultimately only less than one third of the working
time has been left for teaching. 可实际上，老师们却“不务正业”的花费大量的时间去做着其他事情！



忙于应付各种检查、填写各种表格、开展各种活动，真正用于教学的时间三分之一都不到！
