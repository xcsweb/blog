Son came back this afternoon, earlier than expected. I happened to be at our flat when he knocked at the door. Early this morning on my way to our bungalow, I found the usually busy street before the gate of the Central School was deserted suddenly. Obviously its staff and the student body have begun to enjoy their holiday ahead of us. Later at our office I learnt school would be over towards noon. And Mr T would offer a wedding dinner at some hotel in town around lunch time. At Mr W's suggestion, I left school after getting the permission of principal well before the close of school.
