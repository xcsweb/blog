<div align="left"><font size="3" face="Verdana">The reason I sail is because I want to explore.The goal I make is the reason I desire to change.The land I overlook is the birthplace I am from.</font></div><div align="center"><font size="3" face="Verdana"><br></font></div><div align="left"><font size="3" face="Verdana">Once the one is with the will of going nowhere, it is an end. I feel it a must that I have to move. Since I am with power and I do not want to always stay where I am at.</font></div><div align="left"><font size="3" face="Verdana"><br></font></div><div align="left"><font size="3" face="Verdana">Most ones do not like changing because it is hard to break the current situation. They either fear to fail or lack of the confidence to cut off the comfortable zone. As a matter of fact, the worst choice is remaining of nothing changed. Till one day the death arrives, you have no room to hide. What you have then is nothing but the destiny of self destruction. The confidence is not built on words, on the contray, it is the on the base of accumulation of achievements. Whatever you did, wrong or right, they all become the wealth which lonly belongs to yourself. Nobody can steal it, because it is the thing made by you.</font></div><div align="left"><font size="3" face="Verdana"><br></font></div><div align="left"><font size="3" face="Verdana">What if we go into a dead end? Not a big deal. Just try again. There is hope as long as you do not stop and never cave in. One more step, you may find another way to the finishing line.<br></font></div>
