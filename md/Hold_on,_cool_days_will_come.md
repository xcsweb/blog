Thanks to the typhoon, this summer is not to torture me a lot. It usually comes in the night, I just sleep by the companion of the sound of rain and gale overnight. Though it is still summer, it cools down a little bit. I can fully sense the coolness in both morning and evening. Next week, it is reported another typhoon is to form and possibly come.Â The beginning of autumn emerges into the stage and sooner or later, it is getting to be more like that season. Next month it will be much more cooler. Then it can be comfortable to come out.
