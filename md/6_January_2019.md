Began the annual further education on the
net for us teachers.  Toothache has been gone and now
constipation has taken its turn as a result of my inactivity on holiday. It got
worse this morning. No matter how I made efforts, I couldn’t defecate as
before. Then I decided to use the glycerini enema left by late wife. But it didn’t
work either. Finally I solved the problem with the aid of external force. I couldn’t
help admitting that I have been aging both on features and organs. The gastrointestinal
peristaltic function has greatly weakened. My chewing also turns fragile. I must
take measures to avoid the occurrence of constipation by eating more vegetables
and taking more excerise.
