China, many people have bought or are going to buy houses for themselves. As to
where to buy a new house, sometimes it is difficult to make a wise decision.</font></span></span></p>

life is very convenient and comfortable to people living in downtown. For
example, it is always easy to do shopping because there are many different
stores in downtown. In addition, many educational and cultural facilities such
as public libraries, museums are within easy reach.</font></span></span></p>

advantages, I still prefer owning a house in suburbs. I have good reasons to
make such decision. First, the price for a house in suburbs is relatively
cheaper. That is to say, with the same amount of money you use to buy a small
flat in downtown, you can buy an independent house in suburbs. What&#x2019;s more,
living in quiet, peaceful surroundings, you can listen Cicada sing clearly in
summer, you can breathe the fresh air every morning, you can plant whatever you
like such as flowers and vegetables, you can see the mountain through your
winder.</font></span></span></p>

medical facility, which is at least five or ten years later. You know as our
ages, I believe everyone is false health, they may have to have something wrong
after annual health checking, near the hospital or pick up the medicines is
very important for us.</font></span></span></p>
