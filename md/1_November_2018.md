Margaret has been witnessed at Outwood station in the evening when she sees her brother off. When the police inspector comes to her investigating the accident occurring there, she denies she has ever been to the place. Mr Thornton, magistrate of the community, also comes across her and Frederick at the spot. But he advises the inspector against further inquest on the matter when being called on. He hates to see the lady he deeply loves dragged in homicide for Leonards dies shortly after receiving a blow from Frederick. He fully agrees to the surgeon's diagnosis that the drunkard dies of failure of internal organs rather than external force.
