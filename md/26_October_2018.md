The removal of the stove of the central heating system in our bungalow seems necessary because of its leaking pipe. This evening when I tried to heat the kang up by lighting the stove, its mouth produced a rattling noise with massive steam. I have to ask brother to come over for help. 
Since our school was put under the administration of the New District of Changchun Municipality, we have been benefiting and suffering from it simultaneously. Now and then we have been demanded to take teaching training on different subjects at some hard- to- find places in the provincial capital. Almost all of us teachers are reluctant to go and just return after signing names, taking some pictures and making some videos there .
