Most children and adolescents are not happy
today although they need not worry about food and clothing. Every day they live
under high pressure because their parents have great expectations for their
future. They have to study all day long for the admittance to some prestigious
universities. But not all of them are obedient to their parents, as a result,
the relations between the two generations are strained. As a matter of fact,
many of these youngsters fail to come up to the expectations of their parents. For
the decent standard of their life, they lack the impetus to study. Mobile phones
and computer games are more attractive to them. When the conflicts between the
two sides escalate, tragedies may follow.Â
