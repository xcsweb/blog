It was fortunate for Chang to face the cave
murals all day long.对于常书鸿来说，朝夕面对石室宝藏，便是人生最大的幸运。But for Chen, who had been looking forward to the
modern western cultural atmosphere, the grotto life in the Gobi Desert was
unbearable.但对于一直向往西方现代文化氛围的陈芝秀来说，戈壁石室的生活是难以忍受的，She felt sad and embarrassed to change out of
the close-fitting
dress into the baggy old sheepskin coat.









最简单的一个变化——脱下合身的旗袍，穿上宽大臃肿的老羊皮大衣，就让她既伤心又难堪。Their conjugal relation took a dramatic turn
when she was convinced Chang would settle in Dunhuang permanently and  a Mr Zhao tried to alienate her from her husband.


当她确切地知道常书鸿决心永远地留在敦煌，而“第三者”赵某又从中挑动时，夫妻关系便出现了戏剧性的转折。
