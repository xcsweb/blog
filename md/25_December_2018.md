A Christmas Day without any celebration.
Freezing cold weather has just begun to dominate our region and will last up to New Year's Day. The daily temperature will drop to twenty-odd degrees below zero centigrade in this period. 
Came back at noon with an empty stomach because no lunch was offered to us by the school. The first thing to do was shaving my head and chin in the shining daylight at the south balcony. 
Mr W's bad breath and the smell of alcohol from Mr B became aggressive in the narrow room of the car we took. 
To my satisfaction, someone left some pieces of foam board and a wooden frame for packing at my wheelbarrow.
