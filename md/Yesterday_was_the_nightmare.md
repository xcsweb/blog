The day before yesterday Tiger was helped by other
from the company in the morning, I was shocked by the situation. These days he
went to swim and go out in normal, this morning he left home after breakfast to
work by foot, nothing wrong with him, I was told that just sitting in front of
computer for a while, and then He cannot stand up by himself. He has never
happened like this before. 

This was still not attention to him, in the evening he
was the very important appointment dinner with his clients which has booked at
the long time ago, He still insisted to attend it although I have strong reason
with him maybe next day or asked somebody instead. It follows that, He can not
get up from the bed at the next morning, his body was hardly moved. He has
known the serious problems, He called his friends and his sister for helps
immediately. After a few calls, He was ready in hospital by day, He asked me to
take some stuffs daily used be hospitalized.

The driver took us to there on time, I was holding him
slowly to waiting the doctor coming, the doctor we knew was a really busy, and
the long meeting was taken about an hour, but we want to get him, we had to do
it. not bad with the help of his friends in the hospital, he has simply
checking on his body, and let him to making unclear magnetism and B scanning for
detail examine. I can see it is totally different if you know somebody for help
in the hospital, everything is getting smoothly and quickly, I remembered I went
to the hospital for CT checking in one week ago, the reservation was made after
one month later. But today just asked somebody who worked in there helped, what
we wanted everything finished in a half day.

The medical report was not too bad, the waist was need
to has the operation the suggest by the doctor, the disease was very normal as
his ages, but just because of Chinese New Year, maybe after the holiday, he can
come the hospital again detail information, I was just reassurance after whole morning
running around in the hospital. 

Betweenness he is hardly walk right now, I borrowed a wheel
chair from his father for the moment. Or maybe a walking stick is easy and
helping for him.Â
