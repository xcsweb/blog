Chu Zhe persuades the Empress Dowager Zhao 

觸讋説趙太后

As soon as the Queen Dowager Zhao took power,
the Qin State
hastily launched an attack on the Zhao
 State.

趙太后新用事，秦急攻之。

She asked help from the Qi State and was
given an answer that Prince Changan must be sent to the Qi State as hostage in
exchange for dispatched reinforcements. 

趙氏求救于齊，齊曰：“必以長安君为質，兵乃出。”She did not agree to the idea in spite of the expostulations of
her ministers. 

太后不肯，大臣强諫。Her Majesty warned her companions clearly that if anyone dared persuade
her again to let the Qi State hold Prince Changan hostage, she would spit in
his face. 

太后明謂左右：“有復言令長安君為質者，老婦必唾其面。”
