Five Sixteen-Character Songs on Spring 

by Yu Chengyan

十六字令 春五首

作者：余成言

Newly
sprouted spring grass seems to have been turning into carpets.

春，草吐新芽渐似茵，

In
the first rays of the morning sun, the dirt paths have been dyed green.

晨曦里，绿掩陌间尘。The banks
are in a green shade of the thin drooping willow twigs,春，柳线拂堤碧色匀，Which
are so intoxicating when swaying in a sudden breeze.





斜风起，舞醉觅芳人。
