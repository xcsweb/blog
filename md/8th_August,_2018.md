The newly bought writing brush brought me great happiness. I was inclined to write with it when I got free. Its tip keeps gathering together and flexible when used. I can write out strokes and characters I intend. I like it so much that I can hardly tear myself from it. Therefore, I hate to stop my writing with it. I had dreamed of owning a good brush for practising calligraphy. But I grudge spending any money on buying brushes. I had always been using the old bushes left by father and wife in spite of their bad results. It was a rare pleasure for me when Mr Y bought me one not long ago.
