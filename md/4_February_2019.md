Spring
Festival is a joyous occasion for children, teenagers and young people; a
fortune-making opportunity for shopkeepers; also a
harvest season for me, a part-time scavenger, because at this period people
are inclined to discard many old objects for daily use. But it is catastrophic
for the environmental protection. The deafening explosions of fireworks greatly
pollute the clean atmosphere of the neighborhood and violently disturb the
quiet community. Moreover, setting off fireworks is dangerous and can easily
cause a fatal fire. The sanitation workers have to do more cleaning while some
people compete for the winner who has a longer and louder display of fireworks.
