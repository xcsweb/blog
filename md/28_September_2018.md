It cools down further when overcast or rainy. The sunshine becomes lovely and expected. The room I stay in alone at school gets a little cold for the time being. The high pines with dense heads in front of it block most of the sunlight. People have put on thicker and deep colored clothes. And flies have obviously diminished. It is unnecessary to open the north windows because the room doesnâ€™t feel stuffy any more. Soon we'll be required to pay for the supply of central heating. The workers of the heat supply company are being seen checking and rebuilding underground heating pipes in the street.
