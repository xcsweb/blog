<font size="3" face="Verdana">Being cooler though it is still hot in the day. In the night I listen to the crickets.Particularly when I am jogging around, the familiar sound soothes me. They sound uniquely and it tells the domination of autumn is getting stronger. The mid-autumn day is to end and sooner the National Day is coming. How fast it is. Year after year, day after day. After the full moon, it wanes and later is to be bright again.<br></font>
