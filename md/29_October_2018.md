Finished The Mill on the Floss today. A good novel worthy of intensive reading. In this tragedy the most tragic character is the heroine, Maggie. She's a fine, kind and tame girl. But finally she is designed to be killed in a serious flood. She can't marry Philip against Tom' s will. Neither can she elope with Stephen as her admirer intends to hurt her cousin Lucy. One the one hand, she's enviable for both Philip and Stephen love her deeply; on the other hand, she' s unlucky for she cannot marry the man she loves regardless of opposition or reputation. When she returns from the failed elopement planned by Stephen, she' s quite misunderstood and cast aside by the local people. She' s in an agony of despair for she finds she has no way out in her homeland. Maybe death is the best deliverance for her from the misery.
