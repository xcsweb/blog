We returned to the area 50 years later and left
with millions of our childhood memorizes at Shan Xi province Jie Xiu city again. Today
returns to the city where we spent three years there in 1969-1972. We would
like to find out our houses we lived in before, the street lamp where we played
around with fellows together.

This time we found the city changed a lot,
streets are clean and landscape is appealing. I revisited the place Jie Xiu at
the last year with Tiger, but he hardly understood and caught my feeling when I
walked around the place, but this time I went there with six boys and 7 girls
including my two brothers, I would like to be a listener around them, 50 years
ago, it was really long time, I cannot remember clearly some stories in detail,
thatâ€™s why I was willing to join them for four days journey in Shan Xi, even I
was busy my family and Tiger was happy to let me go.

I am the youngest one in among of 13 people, everything
they have planned and prepared properly in advance, such as how many cars and
who with who in one car, I have to say two of them were a really good organizers,
AA is the way for this trip and also we all accept it, one of them to record all
expenses including room charges, meals cost, sightseeing tickets and gasoline
charge. Other one paid first and then he would like claim back afterward.

We started off at early morning 5.15am on
Thursday Jun 20, at the lunch time of the day we arrived the place. It was no
traffic at all on the way, maybe it was not the weekend. The first meal we had
the big round table, talking and laughing from beginning to end, I did many
videos by phone to record the exciting moment.

Revisiting the former remembered the childhood
in three year there. After that we found out the place we living in before, the
rail way was still there even it was no use any more for many years, the part
of old houses were still in, but its went out of cultivation, we were trying to
recall the memorizes where was it, my brothers were very familiar than me, I was
looking for the street lamp there was the spot playing hide and seek in
childhood, to see the old haunt is surely exciting.

Today the former home grounds revisit, did not
have former days to this city loathing instead the heart lives the attachment.
My brother made a banner for photos of this trip, which was expressed our
feeling totally and telling we are back today in searching our roots.
