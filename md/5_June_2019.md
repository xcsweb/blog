An Ode to My Ascending the Building 

登樓賦

At my leisure I climb the tower looking
around into the distance to relieve the tedium for the moment. 

登兹樓以四望兮，聊暇日以銷憂。In my view, the place where the high-rise structure is situated is really bright and spacious without
equal. 

覧斯宇之所處兮，實顕敞而寡仇。The clear Zhangshui River and the zigzag Jushui River converge
here into one. The long islet can be overlooked in the latter.

挟清漳之通浦兮,倚曲沮之長洲。At the back is a high vast plain. In front
are low-lying wet land and irrigation canals.

背墳衍之廣陸兮，臨皋隰之沃流。At the north is the open country where the respected Mr Taozhu was
buried. The tomb of King Zhao of the Chu State lies to the west.

北弥陶牧,西接昭丘。Across the fields are trees bearing fruits and promising crops.

華實蔽野,黍稷盈疇。In spite of its authentic beauty, it's not my
homeland. How can it be worth staying here？

雖信美而非吾土兮,曾何足以少留!
