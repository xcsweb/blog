“All is well “is one of TV play which is very popular
recently, you can see any where at Medias talking about this. It is almost the
end of story this week; I am one of these series trackers although I seldom
watch TV at home except this one.

There is the very traditional Chinese family with
three children, two elder brothers and one youngest sister, the parents were
very look up to men and down on women, preferred boys than girls. As well the
birth control policy at that period, the third child was punished a lot money
for this family, the mother was very tough and she was the master of this family.
So many of complains of house affairs was blamed to the girl, for example
during the school time, the mother forced her daughter to gave up key
university to a teacher college which was much cheaper cost and easy to find the
job after graduation to support his brother. 

The elder brother was an immigrant to US for ten
years, the second boy was spoiled by his mother, he always received financial
support from parents, so the second and the girl were fighting each other at home
all the time, unfortunately the father who was so weak and selfish in this
family, he was never responsible for each one at this among of unhealthy family,
the youngest girl run away from home at her 18 years old, and she never came
back to the sad home even living in the same city for 10 years. 

The surface of the family was good, but after the
mother was dead, everything was changed, unexpected things were hardly control.
The retired life and accommodation for their father was the main issue in front
of three children, to break the peaceful life of them. The father finally got
rid of his wife, in many situations of the daily life, he was making any unreasonable
troubles even more severe demands on their children. Compel the elder one went
back home from oversee and having serious family argument.

Having the great prospect was the girl she was working
in the big company to be a GM, helping her by her Shi Fu when she was a little
girl. She was a rich white collar with big houses and luxury car. Even she swore
she will never touch the family again, but because of the family affection, she
has settled and helped many cases for this family quietly. 

Finally all members of family knew that even we were
from one family, but the communication each other was the most important thing
in this family.
