Dear Mr. Smith,

How are you now?
Iâ€™m writing to express my sincere thanks to you for your big help in the
improvement of my oral English.

Two months ago,
I came to the training center with great hope and admiration. I still remember
my oral English then was so poor that nobody could understand my self-introduction,
which was really a great blow to me. In the following courses that day, I did
not even open my mouth. However, after class you told me that nobody would
laugh at me, what I need to do was to speak, and speak loudly. Under your
encouragement and guidance, I began to speak in the class gradually and
corrected my pronunciation consciously. Two months pass quickly and now I can
talk with English-speakers fluently and naturally. All these are due to your
kind help and excellent teaching, so thank you!

Now I am back in
my own country, and I will begin my work tomorrow. However, no matter how busy
I will be, I will insist on practicing my oral English. So believe that, next
time you see me, you will find that I speak English so well just like a native
speaker.

Best wishes to
you.

Yours sincerely,

Jack Peng
