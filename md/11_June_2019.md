I feel rather
abashed that I don’t follow in the wake of Chao Fu and Xu You
and become a hermit because I hate to change my moral fortitude. I have nothing
to do but drink wine to divert myself from depression and sing out my poems to
dispel my gloom. 

終愧巢與由，未能易其節。

沈飮聊自遣，放歌破愁絕。All the weeds and trees have withered by the
end of this year. The ridges seem to rip under the force of the wind. I, as a
lone traveler, set off at midnight when the sky is overcast with black clouds. 歳暮百草零，疾風高冈裂。
天衢隂崢嶸，客子中夜發。
