When a husband and his wife are spiritually
equal and respect and love each other, we call them a happily married couple. A
perfectly satisfactory marriage is not determined by external factors such as positions,
wealth, looks or schooling but by internal features like kindness, honesty,
modesty and tolerance. Now the young singles tend to select their companions by
objective conditions rather than virtues. Some even fall in love at first sight
and get married quickly. These irrational behaviors may be the reason of a high
divorce rate today. A happy marriage cant’t be obtained without a long time of test of characters.
