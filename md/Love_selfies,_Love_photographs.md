to data from Google trends. Some of people may measure their happiness in
brands and show their success with selfies. My friends take a lot of selves and
won&#x2019;t hang out with people hotter than her. But I love selfies, love
photographs, I like sharing my happiness with others, I like going out with my
friends who are beautiful or not, as long as we have many topics to talk and
more simple mind to deal with.</font></span></span></p>

posting a photo of you taken with a phone in your mirror, but I don&#x2019;t think so,
when I have a good mood with my new hair style or a new dresses, I would like
taking a self shooting for myself to record the moment, when I was old in some
day later, I have never regret to take more young pictures as I do now, because
Time never goes back, that&#x2019;s why I have many selfies in my cell phone in different
post, and most of them after beauty cam.</font></span></span></p>

is cheating others, and lost the natural. In my opinion, find out the photo for
what reason? if it is official use or blind dating, or chatting on the
internet, it is for special reasons, maybe the result is out of your control. For
me I do it only for my love, for my own records. One of my good said posting
too many selfies can put off potential suitor, explaining that they may think
that you are self &#x2013; absorbed or very narcissistic and refrain from approaching
you. So I have seldom to send the photos in my space unless it has emerged to
capture memorable moments, they can mark reunions with family, intimate
moments, with your beloved, and good times shared with friends.</font></span></span></p>

the self photo in 3 seconds in cam. The meaning you can have the time to ready yourself
before you press the bottom, please have a look the photo with my mom to try
with new function I learned, No body believe it was taken by myself, right?</font><span .="font-size: 15pt;"></span></span></span></p><p .="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:
