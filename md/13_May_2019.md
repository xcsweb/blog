The good rain did come at daybreak as
predicted. It is beneficial to the crops and vegetables at the first stage of
their growth.

Father Ralf has been madly in love with
Miss Maggie. But he falsely persuades her to forget him and marry an ideal
husband. Then he leaves so long and never returns until the fire in Drogheda. He departs again after the funeral of Paddy and
Stu. Maggie feels deserted and heartbroken and rashly marries Luke, a shearer
hired on the farm, who looks like Ralf in her eyes, without informing the
priest. Soon she is in deep remorse for her rashness in marriage when she is maltreated.
Her pride keeps her from telling her family any of her sufferings outside.Â
