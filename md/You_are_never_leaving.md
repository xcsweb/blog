You are a star high above the sky while I can not touch you. I never thought I would be like this, I didn't keep my promise and strive for my dream, I am fallen, I am falllen into the unknown darkness. I am afraid at the same time I am happy, I am relieased, and I am enjoy having fun everyday, but I can face my aim, I am here for nine years, I am to write my dream, but 9 years gone, I am the same. I must decide what I do and what not to. You are never leaving, I always had that dream, like they were yesterday, I am happy, and I must make this dream come true.
