Never forget martyrs’ unfulfilled wish and march forward hand
in hand with a tempered will. 

不忘先烈遗志 携手砥砺前行Every piece of land is soaked with martyrs’ blood; in every handful of soil dwell
the souls of the sacrificed heroes. 

一寸山河一寸血，一抔热土一抔魂。Since the modern times, in the struggle for
national independence and people’s liberation, countless revolutionary forefathers of our country,  one stepping into the breach as anther fell,
have composed many heroic epics at the cost of their lives and forged unfading
spiritual monuments. 

近代以来，在争取民族独立、人民解放的道路上，无数革命先辈前仆后继、顽强奋斗，用鲜血和生命谱写出一部部气壮山河的英雄史诗，铸就了永不褪色的精神丰碑。
