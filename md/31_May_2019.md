We should encourage people to do their
business without formality as long as they could attain their objectives. In fact,
there is too much formality in everyday life and work. It's time for us to
quit all formalities for improving the efficiency of our teaching work. The teachers
and the students are required to exchange greetings at the beginning of a class
when the latter have to stand up especially on the occasions when there are
visitors to the lectures. Moreover, the teachers need to announce the opening
of the classes at first and the dismissal by the end. Some courteous teachers also
tell their students to say welcome and farewell to the visitors in time. Â
