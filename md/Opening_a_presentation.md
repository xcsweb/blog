The opening or introduction of your presentation is
the most important part. Use these pointers to help you deliver a successful
opening.

First, welcome your audience, thank them for coming.
Then get people’s attention, present an interesting fact or statistic,
something that introduces your topic to the audience, and gets them thinking.

Offer people a map of your presentation. Your opening
should summarize what you will talk about first, second, third and so on.

Give your audience the rules for questions. Tell them
if they can ask questions at any time or whether they should wait until the
end. It’s your choice.

Practice your opening until it’s perfect.

For example:

Good morning, everyone, Thank you for coming

I’ll start by giving a general update

After that, I’ll tell you about our new projects

Finally, I’ll be giving details about our merger with
Sunset

If you have question, please feel free to ask them at
any time
