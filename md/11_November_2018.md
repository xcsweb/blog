Ate two cloves of garlic at supper for the radish was stewed with some pork without worrying about annoying other people by the offensive smell. Satisfied with the cooking this time for taking a lesson from last time when the oil had not been hot enough for frying the meat and I put it into the pan. As a result, the cabbage stewed that day was not delicious as expected. Today my frying didn’t begin until the oil produced smoke. In the meantime, I kept a quick fire burning under the pot before the ending of the frying. 
Mother is still in a bad mood all day long, thinking aloud ceaselessly. She chatters to me about things displeasing her. She is physically fit but psychologically unfit.
