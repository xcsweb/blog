 It is really a little bit cold now. Indeed, I got cough these few days which lead me felt very uncomfortable. I coughed to die one night, I could not sleep the whole night at that night. So terrible! I even tried to buy the medicine at the mid-night but the nearby medicine shop was closed. At first I thought I was getting heat so that I bought loquat liquid and antibiotic medicine. But it seems the symdrome was getting bad to worse after the eatten two times of medicine. I went for phamacy shop again. The phamacy girl asked my symdrome and said that I was getting cold cough. At that time I got to know that I used the wrong medicine.
