Weather permitting, made much room by selling the large bag of accumulated plastic bottles and a trike load of foam board.
Plastered over the part of ceiling where the plaster had fallen for quite some time. 
Sprayed the cabbages with pesticide. 
Watched the two parts of the documentary named Under the Apple Trees on Channel 9 of CCTV with great interest. It reflects the real life of the Hus as fruit growers. The industrious couple have to look after their retarded grown-up son and daughter while occupying themselves in tending the trees. They are lucky to have a bumper harvest and soon sell all their apples to a fruit company at a reasonable price. The manager of the company must feel much sympathy for the couple.
