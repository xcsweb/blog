Maybe this is an attempt to reestablish the matriarchal clan society in the ancient times. It's the female's turn to run the world. The women have been suppressed too long. But this can be practiced in a small circle to a certain extent. Obviously this presumption is unconvincing. I think the most reasonable explanation should be as follows. When the onlookers had pity for the two girls' choice, they just took narrow-minded views. How could they know the motives of the girls? As the old saying goes, how can a sparrow know the will of a swan? The girls were actually 
Bodhisattvas, quite different from the common people. They have detached their minds from the forms of people and objects, and don’t cling to the notion of an ego any more. So they have forgotten their own good looks and shape, take the disabled as equals. The two men had been chosen prudently for both of them were optimistic and tried to do their best. Then the two  Bodhisattvas decided to deliver them from the sea of bitterness. This is a greater service than chanting the name of Buddha only. They were willing to act as boats carrying the men to the Pure Land. This is an encouragement to the disabled and a lesson to the good-for-nothing young men from the rich families.
