A record of
the Old Drunkard's Pavilion  

醉翁亭記

by Ouyang Xiu

作者：歐陽修Chuzhou City is surrounded by mountains.

環滁皆山也。The woods and valleys among the peaks to
the southwest of it are especially beautiful. 

其西南諸峰，林壑尤美，There is Mountain Langya which looks
thickly forested in the distance and with gorges deep and serene. 

望之蔚然而深秀者，琅琊也。After a six-or-seven-li
walk in the mountains, a traveler can gradually hear flowing water rushing out
from between two peaks, which is the Niang Spring.

山行六七里，渐聞水聲潺潺而瀉出于兩峰之間者，酿泉也。
