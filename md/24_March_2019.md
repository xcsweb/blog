Thank You for Your Coming is a series of programs presented
by Chongqing Satellite TV encouraging the youth to fulfill their aspirations. Â Focusing on the Chinese dream, the theme of
the times, it offers the genuine reflection of the struggling experiences of
the young, eulogizes the youth and spreads positive energy around displaying
gratitude, making apologies and showing love. What I watched was that relayed
on the Channel of Jilin Life. The real stories in the programs have convinced me
of the existence of true love. I am deeply fascinated by the eloquence of the host
and the distinguished guests present.
