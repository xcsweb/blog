Some properties have been put in requisition at
the west end of our town. It has got round that our neighborhood will be laid
under requisition too before long. Skeletons of greenhouses have been
mushrooming recently in the yards of many of my neighbors, who in this way
assume to be compensated more afterwards. I have been used to dwelling in the
bungalow furnished with brick beds heated by cooking stoves. I would rather continue
to live in the house than move into a flat or receive cash in exchange. The
old inhabitants of the bungalow can keep in good health for its connection with
the ground vapor. Moreover, it's convenient for them to move in and out every day. I feel
perplexed at the thought of bidding it farewell one day. How can I bear the
great change？
