I am not good at cooking, the people around me knows
it, but recently I am interesting on Bakery, I don’t know what the reason,
maybe one program on TV or some news from wechat, whatever the reason I pay
attention on any news of baking.

I bought a baking oven which is made of by Germany; I
was told this is good quality with many of good comments in Jing Dong. And I
watched some videos and saw the procedure step by step how to making cakes or
breads those are very basic things on roasting, I have bought some tools and
food stuffs only for some specific items, which is including scale in gram, dough
maker, etc.

Do I have to attend the class for bakery? The first I
just want to learn by myself, maybe I don’t have enough patience after one or
two month later. So I would like to try Cranberry cookies, I thought this is
not too difficult for me, the stuffs I have already in my kitchen. So I looked
at basic recipe and procedure from the internet, to following the step by step to
start my first work, Please see the pictures, can tell I am smart, right? It was
really not bad, some good words and comment from my family for sure, that’s why
I have my confident now to do the next bakery at the following days.
