    The annual party of 2019 will be held in the tomorrow
evening, as usual, each department will prepare at least a program for the
party. Currently, I am not sure if there is a red packet of one thousand for
everybody as last year, but based on annual earnings of 2018, it should be no problem.
As to the first prize, it is said ten thousands cash will be given the lucky
guy instead of physical goods than last year. I think every employee concerns
who can win the first prize or what kind of prize they can have. As normal, the
general manger will do presentation at the beginning of the party and key
persons will be responsible for picking up lucky draw. Another difference is
the party place changed to better place than last year. That means this year
our company got a not good profit at least even outside environment was not
very good especially in automotive industry. As the forecast, the whole
economic status in automotive industry will continue to go down, so our company
also lower the expectation of sales volume accordingly in 2019. In a word, we
will face with more challenge increasing sales volume in 2019. If we don’t get
a good performance in 2019 that means we will have to reduce some profit as
response that we won’t to see. So, anyway, I do hope our company can run smoothly
and get a better performance year after year.
