<p .="MsoNormal" align="left"><span .="mso-bidi-font-size:10.5pt;font-family:" arial","sans-serif""="" lang="EN-US">This is
Saturday, the final day of this week. Whatever it may be also the second last day,
based on our own calculating habit in China. <br></span></p>

<p .="MsoNormal" align="left"><span .="mso-bidi-font-size:10.5pt;font-family:" arial","sans-serif""="" lang="EN-US">A question does
not stop running around my brain, which is how to get a score like 7 or 8 of
IELTS. Normally it shall not be difficult for me, as I think I&#x2019;m a linguistic expert
of the company where I&#x2019;m working. My job is to handle the communication problems with
foreign customs and local authority such as&#xA0; in africa, such as writing them by mails, telephoning them in case of
emergency, as well as preparing bid document and contract agreement etc. in English
or French. <br></span></p>

<p .="MsoNormal" align="left"><span .="mso-bidi-font-size:10.5pt;font-family:" arial","sans-serif""="" lang="EN-US">To pass
IELTS exam, is like a preparation to a &#x201C;war&#x201D; or project initiating. Firstly,
the most important thing or the priority is to choose an appropriate strategy. <br></span></p>

<p .="MsoNormal" align="left"><span .="mso-bidi-font-size:10.5pt;font-family:" arial","sans-serif""="" lang="EN-US">An exam is
an exam, not such big or meaning like a war or a project, but equally complex
as them. A certain amount of vocabulary for the exam covers generally 6000 core
words with the other about 10 000 ~ 20 000 words of so-called commonsense. <br></span></p>

<p .="MsoNormal" align="left"><span .="mso-bidi-font-size:10.5pt;font-family:" arial","sans-serif""="" lang="EN-US">Four different
sections of the exam are listening, reading, writing and speaking. Listening is
the most worrying for me, which needs non-stop practicing of long term, even
though that is what I&#x2019;m working on. Reading and writing is relatively familiar,
because this is part of my job, although my job just covers a tiny range of
civil engineering. Speaking could be a real challenge, because of nearly no
chance, no circumstance of speaking while living and working in Shanghai. <br></span></p>

<p .="MsoNormal" align="left"><span .="mso-bidi-font-size:10.5pt;font-family:" arial","sans-serif""="" lang="EN-US">An
appropriate strategy shall help me do the preparation covering all the above mentioned
for a limited period like one more month. <br></span></p><p .="MsoNormal" align="left"><span .="mso-bidi-font-size:10.5pt;font-family:" arial","sans-serif""="" lang="EN-US">Secondly, that is to practice what i plan as per the strategy chosen. <br></span></p><p .="MsoNormal" align="left"><span .="mso-bidi-font-size:10.5pt;font-family:" arial","sans-serif""="" lang="EN-US">So all of the things after the determination of the strategy is practicing, practicing, practicing for the &quot;war&quot; in order to&#xA0; access into the war relaxingly and </span>leisurely,&#xA0; and to get a score, a satisfying score, the final target .<br></p>
