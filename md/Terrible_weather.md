Wearing winter coat already, 

Winter is not coming yet

The heating has been came to each home

Winter is not coming yet

The autumn rain and wind havenâ€™t gone on yet

Only yellow leaves on the tree is still dazzling and attractive

Sitting in front of the window

Thoughts is running through my head

How come the weather likes this?

The breath is only I can hear.

Want to drink a wine or sing a song

The terrible weather today, making me so lazy and
frustrated. This morning I got the complain from my daughter, let me drive baby
to the hospital, as plan taking the taxi is much easy and convenient than
driving, due to the bad traffic and parking at the rush hours, it is, the
weather of today is heavy air pollution and haze, it is really bad for the baby
outing I can understand, but I got the unfair comments was I am not a competent
person and I did not show my duty for the family. I cannot accept what she
said, I had done the complication procedure personally at the first day at the
hospital, at the following days will only need to have the treatment directly
for the baby, I have to go Heating Company for the payment today, even I was so
angry when I received the call from my daughter, I come to terms actively,
everything at the home the baby is the number one always. Maybe I should blame
the terrible weather which brings me not good of the day.
