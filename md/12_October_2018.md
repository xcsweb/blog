I’m reading George Eliot’s works The Mill on the Floss & Adam Bede with great interest. The former at school and the latter at home. I have long finished her Middlemarch to which I first listened in complete puzzlement on the radio many years ago. And last year I read it on the Net. It is The Mill on the Floss that moves me most among the three works above-mentioned. I couldn’t keep back my tears twice during my reading. When Mr Tulliver  gets irritated by quarreling with Mrs G, one of his wife’s sisters, he’s also displeased with his sister’s  husband and rushes to claim the money lent to them for repaying Mrs G. But he regrets deeply soon after pressing the poor couple and cancels the claim for he hates to see Tom hard on Maggie in the future as he does towards his sister. The second time I shed tears was today when I read the family council after Mr Tulliver goes bankrupt. The tragic atmosphere is extremely moving.
