Ever
tried, ever failed;

No
matter, try again;

Fail
again, fail better.

Maybe
you know nothing about Peter Dinklage, but you are bound to know about the role
he ever played in Games of Thrones. You bet！He was ever famous as Tyrion Lannister, the little
devil. 

 Suffering
achondroplasia, Peter Dinklage is only 1.35 meters high. Nevertheless, his
small figure does not hinder his excellence in acting. Besides Games of Thrones,
he also had roles in The Station Agent
and Narnia.

 Believe
it or not, Dinklage did not find his ideal job until 29. Moreover, in his
darkness, he couldn’t even find a suitable shelter. Everything changed at his
age of 29. He found a job acting in a play called imperfect love, which led to a film called 13 moons with the same writer, which led to other roles. Since
then, he has spared no pains to work as an actor.

 “Raise
the rest of your life to meet you.” Peter Dinklage said.

 Facing
the fact that he would leave from data processing, Dinklage felt a little bit
anxious. But an idea stroke to him that he should make a difference in his own
life. It was this ambition that supported him to live up to his reputation.
After these trials, a thought came into his mind, “don’t search for defining
moments because they will never come”, “but only if you try again and again,
something starts to happen. Trust me. A rhythm sets in.”

 Carol
Burnett once said, “only I can change my life. No one can do it for me.” So,
young man, what are you waiting for? Every chance brings out if we strive for
it. In this way, we are obliged to change ourselves. By achieving this, we
should change our mind. 

 And
remember, we burn so brightly, so please never stop.
