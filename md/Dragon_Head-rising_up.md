Dragon Head-rising up is Lunar of second day in February.
After this day the people can go to Barber shop having the hair cut, people all
said that if you do the hair cut within the first month of lunar year, your
uncles will die because of this. So nobody wants to have any complaint from
relatives, as the time passes, the people are following the rule including me.

Yesterday was after this special day and I was not busy,
I wanted to make up my hair in dark brown colour as usual to cover some white
ones. So I went to a barber near my home. You know I have my long hair for many
years, I am so confident for my hair due to it is heavy and strong then others,
that’s why I am looking more younger, hehe, I said to myself always. I went to
the barber only a few times a year, I did not know which shop is good or not.

I entered the barber after my breakfast, I was so
happy to see there are only two customs and two service boys, I thought I did
not wait for long time for sure. Can you come here this afternoon if you don’t
mind? one boy said. Even his voice was so polite but I was refused by them I
felt, I was shocked and answered him immediately, ok got it, I would go to
other shop next to you, my response was also respect and determined. You know this
shop I will not come again in the future, because I felt I am not so welcomed
by them, they will be lost one of potential clients. If the boy let me have the
seat first I can understand even I hate to waste my time, in fact, only the boy
said one word just casually, but the oblivious transfer to my mind, I believed
his boss who was starting up the business was so sad to lose the business at
the pressure of the investor.
