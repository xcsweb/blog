I’ve been absent here for a whole fortnight without writing diaries
since mother came down with lumbago. She can’t take care of herself any more. I
have to look after her all day long. Last week I took a leave from work to care
for my sick mother. I think I should work this week with mother entrusted to
brother and sister. I got the permission to come late and leave early premised
on conducting my classes in time.
