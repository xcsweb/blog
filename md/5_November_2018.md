The other day my phone had been unable to be connected. I had thought it accidental and quite sure not due to arrears. Unluckily today I couldn’t dial out again. Now I was certain that something must have been getting wrong and I must find it out immediately.  So instead of going to work, I first headed for the branch telecommunication bureau seeking a solution of the problem. The clerk told me my phone card had outlived its usefulness. Then I had the old card replaced by a new one with the number unchanged, which cost me ¥ 16 plus my ID being shown.
