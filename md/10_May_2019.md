The narrow cement road I pass every day
needs reinforcement at both sides for they are so low and soft at some
sections.

King X didn’t kill the Duke of P at the banquet in
H as his counselor F suggested. Then F predicted His Majesty would be doomed to
failure. Some sympathizers of X say if he had slain L at the moment as advised,
he wouldn’t have gotten into the plight of committing suicide at W River in the
end. Owing to his heroic character, he wouldn’t do that disgraceful thing. At the
time, he had never perceived L as a threat to him. This has earned him the
respect and love from the author of his biography and the futurity up to now
although he failed at last. Until his death, he hadn’t realized his fatal error
to conquer the world only by force.
