 Today is a little bit cool. Expecially I wear short-sleeves cloths. Maybe it can soothe the pressure and calm down the temper. Indeed I am not that kind of people who are easy to get anger. But I am easy to twist the heart when I am facing the problem. Otherwise, I am used to hurry up to solve the problem when I meet the unforseen circumstances. It is not good. It is a weakness of my character. I hope I can be more calmly when I face and deal with the immergency condition. Some little problem actually makes you deal with the things better. It is accumulated your ability to react with the issue what you're facing. But, I think it can not be bothering us if it is just small and little issue.  I feel good maybe it is because the cool weather. Anyway, I surely will find one day to go for mountain climbing. I just have long time not climbing. Shame! I was too lazy!
