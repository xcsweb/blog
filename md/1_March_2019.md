If
you want to be respected, please show respect for others first. I don’t think
this old suggestion can hold water. If you long to win the respect of others,
you must be qualified for the honour. Polite and friendly greetings are not
enough for earning the respect of the man you offer. So you must make great
efforts to realize your aim. Only distinguished achievement in some field can
help you to be a revered person. It is a pity that nowadays the world seems to
respect the man of great influence and large wealth. Even the renowned master
of Chinese poetry is just admired by some scholars.
