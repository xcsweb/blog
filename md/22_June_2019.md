As an official, I'm granted exemption from
taxes, hard labor and military service, and my family still suffer from poverty,
let alone the hardship of the civilians. 

生常免租税，名不隶征伐。
撫跡猶酸辛，平人固騒屑。As for the landless peasants and the garrison soldiers at the
far frontiers, they share the same fate. My anxieties about our country and
compatriots are boundless and unceasing. 
默思失業徒，因念逺戌卒。
憂端齊終南，澒洞不可掇。
