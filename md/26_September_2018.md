Today is Wednesday. In the evening, after watching the weather forecast, I changed the channel from No 13 to No 3 of the CCTV to appreciate the program Get Braver with Fighting. It's more like an affectionate program than a singing contest only. Usually each participant has to introduce himself and relate his educative experiences of life. As a result, it is their moving stories we can remember even after a long time rather than their singing. Most of the participants are amateur singers. Sometimes a professional singer is permitted to turn up. In such circumstances, the competition seems unfair to the amateurs.
