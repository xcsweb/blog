Du Fuguo lost his eyes and hands in an
explosion when he was demining at the jungle bordering Vietnam. It happened
on the afternoon of 11 October 2018. Facing an unidentified explosive found at
the minefield, he volunteered to take the place of one of his comrades-in-arms tackling
the problem. He barked, “You retreat. Let me try.”Afterwards all sorts of honors heaped upon him. He’s still rehabilitating in
hospital and to have artificial limbs installed. He can walk freely but has
great difficulty in eating, dressing, undressing and relieving himself. He determines
that he can take care of himself one day through prolonged practice.
