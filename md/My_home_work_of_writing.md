Proposal for our budget crisis

Read the email from your manager. Then respond with an
email that has several ideas to help her solve the budget problem.

Hi Rosanna

I really need some help on creating some proposals for
the budget crisis. Please give me as many ideas as possible for cutting costs.

Thanks 

Carla

Dear Carla

I have read your mail and let me give you my ideas for
saving the cost for our company. A large number of the cost is the salary and
benefits in our financial report, so the first option is to cutting everyone
back to 35 hours a week. Another possibility is to offer older workers a
retirement bonus. We may have to consider more drastic options, like cancel the
annual leave, reducing staff meal from three to two times a day. I believe
those can save a lot costs. Only as a last resort do we lay off workers. 

Please have a look and Thanks! 

Rosanna
