How time flies ,my daughter  has now 2 years old.As  a dad I enjoyed much  more joy  than I suffered sorrows.No matter how tired I am I feel  full of energy as long as I think of my litter girl.I work more harder in order to give her better environment.I keep on reading and studying in order to set a good example  for her.I become fascinated with visiting shopping websites in order to come across with surprising gifts for her.Deep in my heart I feel I am totally changed.I am willing to sacrifice everything to make sure her happiness.Perhaps I am not wealthy enough however I can accompany her as long as I can .Perhaps  I am not wise enough however I can grow up together with her.In a word  I will love her in my own way.I will always love her till the end of my life.
