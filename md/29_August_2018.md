The predicted moderate rain had started when I awoke this morning. I had to give a lesson at the second period. Now that it was seven o'clock and the rain outside didn’t subside. I couldn’t wait any longer or I would be late. I decided to take the bus between the town and X village where our school is located. I carried the heated breakfast to school and on my arrival I phoned brother at once asking him to tell mother I wouldn’t go to her. When school was over, I headed for home on foot, hating to ask my driving colleagues for a lift.
