Now that I learnt through the Net it would rain tonight, I began to sort out the disordered things across the yard as soon as I returned home. Moved some of them into the shed; gathered those left outdoors closely together with them covered. It had been drizzling before I completed the job. The light rain would probably turn into a moderate one later at night as the forecast had said. It will be sleeting tomorrow. I heard some of my driving colleagues thinking of getting their car tyres changed for snow ones. The slippery snow-covered road will be a great challenge to these drivers.
