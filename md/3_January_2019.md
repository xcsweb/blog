It is a pity I can't withdraw the large sum
accumulated from my Medical Insurance Card, which is only permitted to pay the
expenses of drugs. The other day I heard at a pharmacy that flour and oil can
be bought at the drugstores in Changchun with the card. It satisfied me to a
degree. But it is very inconvenient to do the shopping. Recently I happened to
buy some medicines at a newly-opened chemist's shop, which is quite different from the other local ones. That is I
have to leave my card there for days for a formal receipt after buying drugs. I
learnt it's a branch store of the main in Changchun, so I can purchase flour and
oil without leaving for the provincial city.
