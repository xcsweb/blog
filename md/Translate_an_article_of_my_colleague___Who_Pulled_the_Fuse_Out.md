" Around 10
a.m., power cut took place, which is a common thing in Djibouti. And then, self-provided
diesel generator was launched automatically so there was no influence to us. Suddenly,
the doorbell rang. I went downstairs and saw that Ahmed our Ethiopian guard was
talking to me with fingers waving, but I couldn't understand him.

Ahmed then
gestured me to the outside of the yard. Several young men stood in back of a
white pick-up and began to talk something with hand signs when they saw me. I could
not understand them either and they went away.

The guard immediately
showed me a white box with electrical company sign at corner of the wall, and
found that two of the four fuses had been pulled out. Based on hand signs of
Ahmed, I realized it was the young men who took away them. 

So I called
our translator Luc at once, who went to logistic company one hour ago. 

‘There were
some little punks stole our fuses away and power is cut now,’ I told him. 

‘That might
be done by the staff of power bureau, probably because we did not pay the
electricity bill timely.’ Luc replied.

Luc came
back soon and took previous electrical bill to go to EDD (Power Bureau of
Djibouti). He paid the electrical bill of this month, but their staff of taking
fuses went far away from our block. ‘Today is Friday, so I must contact to a local
friend of EDD to return back the fuses this afternoon, otherwise the power cut will
continue during this weekend’ Luc said.

‘The guy of
EDD likes Chinese cigarettes; I’m going to give the cigarettes as a gift to him in order to let him send his staff to put the fuses
back this afternoon.’ he explained

Sure enough,
the generator stops working in afternoon and the power is switch on again. The
guys of EDD know how to choose right time."
