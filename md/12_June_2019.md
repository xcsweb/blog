My fingers are
numb with cold in the frosty weather and fail to make the broken belt tied
together. At daybreak as I pass by Mount Li the emperor is at the top of it
taking shelter from the cold and enjoying himself in the hot spring.   

霜嚴衣帶斷，指直不得結。

凌晨過驪山，御榻在嵽嵲。

 The thick mist in
the cold air makes the mountain path feel slippery. A large number of imperial
guards are stationed at the Jasper Lake with steaming hot spring.

蚩尤塞寒空，蹴蹋崖谷滑。

瑶池氣鬱律，羽林相摩戛。
