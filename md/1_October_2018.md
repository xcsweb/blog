The first day of National Day holiday, good sunshine followed the heavy rain last night but a little cold in the early morning. It gradually got warmer around noon. Seeing the bedroom so warm with bright sunlight, I couldnâ€™t help considering cleaning my body and changing my underwear. The fine weather will last at least for a few days according to the forecast. This is what we want for working after son's departure. He has booked the train ticket back to school the day after tomorrow. Mother has to move to the west room when the kang in the east room is torn open for clearing the ash inside.
