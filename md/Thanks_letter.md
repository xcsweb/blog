I have transferred to this fitness for two months,
General speaking it is so so. There are three floors inside, the facilities and
equipment is pretty old, and there are two locker rooms separately. The sauna room
is closed for long time, the slippers are not in ordered. Maybe I am too picky
for the tidy in the public, especially for the bath room expectation is much
higher than other areas, and I always compare with San Quan Japanese Club. The
Swimming pool is bigger I like it, the treadmill machines is ten pieces and it
is quite enough for the rush hour, and four of them are the new one I was told.

Every morning I come out a half hour early then it is opening,
just in order to catch up Tigerâ€™s breakfast, normal I put my sport bag in front
of the door first, after I am running back, the bag has been in to the room,
after that I realized Mr. Liu who is almost 50 years old, the whole morning only
he is on duty of the club, in fact he is only in charge the clearing work for
the club, but sometime he is the receptionist at the counter or sometime he is
the engineer technical worker for electricity and machine maintenance. I always
receive a nice warm regard greeting from Mr. Liu when I am coming in. I can see
the floor is cleaned and mopping by him already, the machine has been made up
even some corners are not covered yet under my eyes. If you can see his smiling
face you would forgive him, due to he is a nice guy really.

At the last week, he said to me carefully, Can you
write a thanks letter for me to my leader? I asked him why, what for? He told
me honestly that he could get the special bonus base on the number of good
comments. This kind of managements to encourage staff motivation is good or not,
it is hard to say, I just a little surprised that he asked for the letter only
for the money, and it is not from guests voluntarily. But anyway I promised him
to say no problem.

At the second day I put my envelope with my warmly
words to their counter. He was so happy for my action. He is more warmth from
his face I can read.
