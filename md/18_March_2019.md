The weather of early spring is really
changing and unsteady. It was warm yesterday but it gets bitterly cold and
sleety today. I had to wear a scarf, a pair gloves and a hat that can cover my ears. On
my way to school, I spotted a few farmers begin burning the remains of the dry corn
stems and leaves in their fields in preparation for the approaching sowing. As I
returned more and more peasants joined the burning which is banned by the local
government. The local people have always been dealing with the remnants of the
dead plants in this way. The government only knows to issue orders but fails to
direct how to solve the problems. Now so many people should challenge the authorities
and violate the law and discipline, would the government punish these offenders
as it has declared ?
