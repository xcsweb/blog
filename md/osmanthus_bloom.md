     The autumn is  coming. It's so cold these days that I have to put on a coat in the morning and evening.       I aways jogging with  trunks and T-shirt, but it's a little cold last night.  I even almost no sweat after 6 Km jogging.      I smell a sweet smell in the air when I was jogging in the the community . I try to find where is it coming followed the sweet smell. Then I found the smell come form the bloomed osmanthus. The yellow flowers are so small but the smell is  strong.  Three girls were picking the flowers from the tree, maybe they will use them to do some delicious food.  There are many osmanthus trees in the community, so there must be a great smell if all the osmanthus in full bloom.       Autumn is a harvest season,  many delicious fruits is coming.
