Out of regard for the high divorce rate
today, I advise the young singles not to marry too early and quickly. Every one
desires to seek a companion through life. We all envy those devoted couples who
have accompanied each other until the end of their lives. A lifetime marriage
cannot be harvested easily. It needs both sides of the couple to be virtuous.
The young might as well learn from the old couples who have celebrated their
golden wedding anniversaries or diamond wedding anniversaries. Both sides
should not change their original intentions in spite of what has happened. That
is to say, loyalty is the most important. In addition, tolerance, considerateness,
responsibility and filial obedience are also necessary.Â
