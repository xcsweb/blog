I think calligraphy only refers to the art
works written by the Chinese brush. But now the word has been widely abused. The
handwriting by the pen is also called calligraphy or hard-tipped pen
calligraphy. Moreover, don’t you feel it ridiculous when we often hear someone
or another is vey casually addressed as calligrapher？Not all character writing can
be named calligraphy. Only those excellent art works finished by the writing
brush can be worthy of the word. So the course offered at school in character
writing can be called handwriting at most. We should be pleased if our
schoolchildren can write characters neatly with patience.
