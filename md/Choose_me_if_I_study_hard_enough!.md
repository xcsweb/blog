          I always fall into the thinking of the life when my boys grow up .They will not hold me and tell me everything about themselves.Their friends are more important than parents then,and they'd like to share secrets with the friends.They are moving away from me little by little. It is not surprised for me if either of them doesn't allow me to get into his room one day.         Therefore,there must be something else which can be my spirit bailment. I think it's my career,which I will fling myself into.Yes! I have not have a job yet. I have found it,but I am not sure whom the job will choose.I need to study harder and harder as there is a chance to me . The result maybe the answer of my life no matter it is good or bad.Just try and trust myself!
