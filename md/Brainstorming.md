This word was so impressive in my mind. More than ten
years ago when I worked in one of international hotel, one training teacher
from Canada gave us the lesson about the discussion the leadership. Foreign
teacher was much different with our Chinese teacher, at the first 5 minutes of
the class, She wrote the big word on the white board “brainstorming”, nobody
knew what’s the meaning of it, I checked my dictionary under the table
carefully, how come I did not find it out from it, I felt so embarrassing when
she was calling me on the class, She was trying to explain the meaning in many
ways, I just knew it roughly. That’ why I have never forgotten this word till
today.

Brainstorming is a creative technique used by group to
find possible ideas or solutions for a specific problem. Ideas are written down
as members of group think of them. There is no analysis of the ideas at the
time.

The most important thing is to let group members know
that there are no bad ideas in brainstorming. The point is to gather as many
ideas as possible. There should be no judgment ideas can be evaluated later.
People should feel free to say whatever they think of. Even crazy or wild ideas
– thinking outside the box – should be welcomed. You never know which ideas
will turn out to be the best ones. Sometime ideas can also be combined.

Brainstorming doesn’t always generate the best ideas,
but it can build trust among group members and encourage people to speak more
freely without fear being judged. It can help a team come together and building
a strong team.

Now I have fully understood the meaning of the word.
