The fair green tree in the yard is dense with
blossoms.

庭中有奇樹，緑葉發華滋。I pull down and break off a twig with flowers
for presenting to the man I'm missing. 

攀條折其榮，將以遺所思。
Even the front of my clothes and sleeves carry
the fragrance of flowers. However, I can hardly send it to my love for the long
distance.     

馨香盈懷袖，路逺莫致之。The flowers are not worth prizing. I just intend
to express my yearning toward him after the long separation.

此物何足貴，但感别經時。
