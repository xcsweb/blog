October is the best time in autumn to see the red
leaves of the maple tree everywhere in our eyes. Every year our friends for
sure would not miss the chance in Beijing. We have been to many famous places
at this season, so this year we went to Badaling national forest Park in suburbs
of Beijing, Red hill is the nice colourful picture you will see.

We checked the weather of the day one week ago, and we
planned to go there green commuting and stagger the rush hour, so we went out
9am to take the subway first and then transfer to the special vehicle. We were
surprised that the ticker seller gave us very details information for the
scenic area even her voice was too loud and noisy, including the time of final
bus for the return, the better way of good view of the mountain and you might
go by foot or by cable car. So it was very caring for the new comers.

Ms Jiang Li is our captain in our group, due to she is
always the organiser for the outing, She would like doing very details plan for
any tours of us, the address, the transportation, the accommodation and control
the time and safe, some time she was the driver, she was quite smart for using
the digital equipment, she like taking her sheltie stick for the group picture,
and also taking her smart camera which taking the photo are more colourful and
clear. I can see without her outing will not have so fresh and meaningful.

The park is not so high mountain with all stairs, it
is easy for all kind of people coming, a little cloudy of the day, only till
the lunch time there are some white clouds hanging of the blue sky, we should
thank the day for our outing and shooting, the good view of the red maple
leaves are all in the back side of mountain, Great wall to be the back ground into
our eyes, some green, yellow, golden and red colour are mixing together, very
great and beautiful, just like needlework on the cloth picture, we did not
missing any corners for shooting or videos to record the wonderful moments. I
believe if you come here, you would forget any unhappy things around you and
you will have smiling face to the people around you always.Â
