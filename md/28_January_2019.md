Today is the twenty-third of the twelfth month by
the lunar calendar and called Little New Year. Before breakfast I began
kneading dough for making dumplings later for son. I saw that the dough was
mixed soft. After having a hasty breakfast, I started chopping pork and a part
of a cabbage as stuffing for jiaozi. Yesterday I specially bought a bottle of
vinegar for dipping in when mother and son eating dumplings during the Spring Festival.
Mother deems that on the lunar New Year's Eve and the lunar New Year's Day dumplings are
a must on the dining table.Â
