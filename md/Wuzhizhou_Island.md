LiLi suggested we’d better go to Wuzhizhou Island for
one day tour, as we knows the place is very famous and many of travel agents is
making the place a special line for young couple, it must be the reason.

Between Wuzhizhou Island to Lin shui is only 80 kilometres
away, one of friend had been there before, so four of us renting one car for a
day just enough, the diver was a local young boy, he was waiting us at the
entrance of our community at the early morning, travel light is the best way
for one day, only one small bag and some finger foods and water, as we were
told foods and beverages on the island is extremely expensive.

To the island we had to take the passage ship which
was taken about 15 minutes, the ticket is 144 yuan including round trip, and we
had to pay other 80 yuan for trolley bus which is stopped as you want, the
meaning in the island no any vehicles except this kind of bus, it is good for
green environment. The bus was going the island around, I was a little frighten
when I was on the bus, I cannot make a nice photo and due to it was too fast
even I told the driver, Please slowly, he said the speed of it is limitation,
otherwise the next one will follow closely, any way the view is beautiful, I
pressed the photo as quickly as I can to catch any corners of the view, luckily
I was seating at the side, easy to take the full photo.

The sunshine day it was, the blue sky with the blue
sea within the same colour and in one picture, any corners of the photo like a
postcard, I was so happy go out with my friends who know how to make a good
photo, and they have enough patient for your different poses in one site. If Tiger
with me to be there, for sure I cannot have many satisfaction photos, due to he
was less of sense for the picture.

We visited Lover Valley and Mazu temple, those place
have their own stories. Good luck for lovers, they can be falling in love for
ever at the place, the temple is bless with safeness for all fishers and people.

It is a really beautiful place I have never seen before;
the time is too short, the seaside and the air I really was missing there till today.
Please see my pictures I wanted to share with you all.
