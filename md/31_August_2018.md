My terribly aged mother went to the market alone in my absence for purchasing a reel of thread for sewing. When she told me that later, I could not help reproaching her violently for her rashness. I have been urging her again and again not to risk leaving far away from home without my knowledge. She might walk about within sight of our front gate when weather permits. And I stated clearly if necessary I could accompany her to any place where she would like to go. But she was always deaf to my advice. She often expressed that she was sure of herself.
