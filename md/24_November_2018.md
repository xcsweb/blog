It was reported recently that some wild Asian elephants frequented the villages near the primeval forest in Yunnan. They came just for food. All the local people know they are protected by law, so no one has ever attacked these intruders though they have caused great damages to their properties and crops. Certainly the victims can claim compensation for their losses. Neither driving them away nor building defenses can solve the problem. To lay food for them on the outskirts of these villages cannot be a permanent solution. It seems to me that the best way is the complete withdrawal of all human activities there and returning the space to the elephants.
