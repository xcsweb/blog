Both wheels of the chariot got stuck in the
mud and its four horses were entangled in the reins. The drum was thumped loudly
by sticks embedded with jade. 

霾兩輪兮縶四馬，援玉枹兮撃鳴鼓。
All the fighters were cruelly slain and
deserted on the battlefield. Heaven was exasperated at the scene.   天时墜兮威靈怒，嚴殺盡兮棄原壄。On their way to the far front meeting the
invading enemy, they hadn’t expected to return alive. 


出不入兮往不反，平原忽兮路超逺。Wearing swords and bows from the Qin state,
they fought heroically to the death. 

帶長劒兮挾秦弓，首身離兮心不懲。They were really both brave and powerful,
unyielding to the end.

誠既勇兮又以武，終剛强兮不可凌。
Your bodies are dead, but your souls are still
alive as heroes among the ghosts. 


身既死兮神以靈，子魂魄兮為鬼雄！
