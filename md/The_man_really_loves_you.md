When a man really loves you, he will be interested in you. He will respect your ideas and opinons, even when he doesn't agree. He will pay attention to details about your likes and dislikes, and he will accommodate your needs to the best of his ability.If he respects you, he will compromise on little things, like shopping with you he doesn't care for because he knows you like it, or bigger issues, compromise is an important sign that he really loves you. True compromise doesn't mean "I will do this for you, if you do this for me". It is not a negotiation.  If the man really loves you, he will treat you with respect. He won't degrade you or put down your achievements. A man rellay loves you will pay attention to what you like and dislike. He will try to make sure you are happy, because your happiness really matters to him.
