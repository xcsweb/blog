    Every day, I was involved with lots of trivial things even it has less important to me, but, I have to cope with it with much energy. I don't know whether other guys have similar feeling, but, I always have the feeling that I only take forty percent energy to deal with real problem with my technical skills, as to the rest of energy I have to learn or deal with all complicated procedures in internal, that means, most of time waste on handle procedures and less time for professional skills improved. I think it is most of guys faced in manufacturing company especially for those whose is working on manufacture engineering. To be honest, due to most of time, we just faced with all kinds of automatic machines and less opportunity communicate with customers directly so that we might be good at technical skills, but might be not good at getting along with customers or even colleagues. That is an actual shortcoming to us, sometimes, we also need to show off our strength in front of our boss especially in every critical moment.    Now, the year of 2018 will pass by soon, we will continue the current trend if we already keep a good performance, we will try to stay positive impression on your boss if you are not getting a decent performance during the past months, because the yearly salary raise will be finished be the end of month so that we have to care about the only chance of salary raise.
