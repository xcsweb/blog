We need to keep the hills green and the
waters clear when mining gold and silver from the mountains.

我们既要绿水青山，也要金山银山。

We would rather have green hills and clear
waters than amass fortunes from gold and silver mining. Green hills and clear
waters are great wealth.

宁要绿水青山，不要金山银山，而且绿水青山就是金山银山。Why is polygamy enforced in Paraguay？ It has only a population of 7,000,000
and most of which is female. The seven-year long war from 1862
had left three-fourths of its male population dead. With regard to the
disproportionate ratio of men to women, the government has decided to practice polygamy
making sure all the women are married off. In such an underdeveloped country, all
the husbands have great family pressures for supporting so many wives.
