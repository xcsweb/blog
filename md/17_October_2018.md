The good rope I had lent to the two motor-cyclists was not returned today. Yesterday I met them half-way from school. I saw them walking with their motor bikes. One of the cycles seemed out of order and needed to be pulled by the other. They asked me for a rope because one of the men thought I must have. He often saw me carrying fuels on the road. Learning they are from the village near our school, I offered a solid rope to them. I demanded they return it later at the grocery by the road in the village.
