Today when I came across my English blog
and I found a comment here, wondering why I haven’t posted for such a long
time. I’m touched. English learning is just my little hobby. It has become an
inseparable part of my life. It is English writing that pulls me out of my warm
bed every day--considering the weather here right now, take my word for it, it really
says something. 

 

I need this little mind game to kick me
into fully function, which means I’m writing on a daily basis. However, most of
my writings are just bits and pieces stuff, hardly presentable. And since I’ve
been almost occupied all the time, I haven’t troubled myself to keep my
writings, until now. 

 

It’s the end of year. I’d better spare
sometime to sort them out and put them there. Formality, no matter what, is necessary
in our life. (Here I’m really trying to say: 生活需要仪式感.
So if you had better idea, please let me know.) 

 

Just as I said before, imitation writing is
a good start if you don’t know what to write about. Here is the one for today：

 

We need to think about our wishes
differently. Sometimes it may not lead to happiness, it leads to our downfall
instead. Human beings have the freedom to wish for anything they think they
want. When we are sober and clear-minded, we will wish for the things that make
us better and make us happy. But when we aren’t—because we’re traumatized,
misled or lost in this hustle and bustle world, we will wish for something that
might harm us. The path out of unhealthy wishes is to form healthy wishes, to
be connected to your inner voice, to understand what you truly wanted. Despair
is just one symptom of the cries after wrong placed wishes granted-- that’s
happening all around us. For too long, we’ve talked only about granting a wish.
But we need now to talk about making a wish right. The opposite of wish is not
despair; the opposite of wish is to be misled.
