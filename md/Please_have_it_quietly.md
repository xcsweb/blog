It gets warmer and even to be hot like summer. The changeable weather makes no possibility of experiencing a smooth spring.Â  You have little chance to decide what kind of smart clothes you are to wear. Because it always ends up quickly and then comes the summer. The moist of air is the ideal environment for mosquitoes. They come and bite and suck. What a tiny little creature which can be so strong at blood sucking. I do not know if there are vampires but I realize they are the real version of Dracula. They can be found in desert. They can be still on walls or somewhere else when it gets cold and come out again as it is warm enough to activate them. If I were bothered as they hum before I fall asleep, I would kick the bucket. After getting up, itchy hands remind me of their banquet. It is not that bad, what a good news, at least, I did not know the buzz thanks to their silent party on my arms.
