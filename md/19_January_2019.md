You have pupils everywhere and raise seedlings
for the country.

种得桃李满天下，心唯大我育青禾。You are the vernal breeze, silkworm and mud
shielding the flowers.

是春风，是春蚕，更化作护花的春泥。You love your motherland at the expense of your
personal interests. 

热爱祖国，你要把自己燃烧。The paddy strikes its roots deep into the soil;
you've also taken root
in the hearts of humanity.

稻谷有根，深扎在泥土，你也有根扎根在人们心里。
