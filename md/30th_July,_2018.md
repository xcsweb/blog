Today was not as hot as expected. I took some concrete steps to reduce the dominant intense heat. Before breakfast I rode the trike to the flat specially for fetching the electric fan. I opened all the bungalow windows front and back. We did not light the cooking stove for preparing lunch and supper any more. We used the electric cooker instead. Moreover, we ate some green bean cakes as well. We took our supper earlier than usual before dark. We managed to avoid turning on the lights attracting the mosquitoes and other insects. Stayed indoors or in the shade and took a rest when feeling tired. Cancelled all the activities outdoors in the sun. Â
