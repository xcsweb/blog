When I was in primary and middle school, we criticized with
teachers the conception of” Whereas buying ship is better than building it, renting
ship is better than buying it.” 

As a graduate student in university, my
tutor helped us analyze the positive and negative aspects of LDCs’development
strategy of Import Substation. What I learned from above all those years have
little effects on my life later on. 

Now my daughter is settling down in
Shanghai. She knows nothing about IS and less about the choice of buying or renting
ships, but she understands that the loan shops are lion shops. A pragmatist, she,
in turn, has been renting a flat not far from her company and happily moves to it
everyday in Mobike bicycle and back home on foot.
