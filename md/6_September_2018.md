The second day I obey the call of duty as a sanitation worker. I daren’t neglect my duty. I did cleaning outdoors as long as possible. I worked mainly beside the pathway from the gate to the office buildings within view. I want to give our principal a good impression at the beginning. So for the time being, I have almost suspended practicing calligraphy and reading at school for which I can make up later. Although my job seems disgraceful, I think it fits me. I’m glad not to contact with the students again. It’s beyond my ability to keep discipline in my classroom.
