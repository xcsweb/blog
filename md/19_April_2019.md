A 49-year old mother has passed the postgraduate
entrance examinations with her son in the same year after accompanying him
studying at college, dreaming of becoming a teacher by getting a PhD.   

49岁“陪读妈妈”和儿子成为同一届研究生：梦想读博当老师 It’s never too old to learn. In the eyes of the 49-year old Aunt Yuan from Henan,
this is not only a slogan. 

活到老学到老，在49岁的河南原阿姨的眼里，这不单单只是一个口号。In last December, she took part in the entrance
exams for postgraduate schools with her son. After the announcement of the test
scores, the son was admitted to Fudan University as graduate student, and Aunt Yuan also
gained admission to Guangxi
 University as
postgraduate majoring in Chinese international education.

在去年12月份，原阿姨和儿子一起考研，最终考研的成绩下来之后，儿子被录取为复旦大学的研究生，而原阿姨也被广西大学的汉语国际教育专业录取为研究生。A lad committed suicide
by jumping from a bridge just before his mother. What's
wrong with the domestic education？
