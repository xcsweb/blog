Janie had the plan to US for traveling, mainly visiting for nature view
including Yellow park and Grand Canyon. Tiger and I has been to America in year
2012 with his sister, even we went to many cities from east of US to the
western part, that time we were focus on human landscape and places of
historical figures and cultures, invite us to go with them together in October.
Yellow park is one of our favorite place all the time, and we were told
everything the friend has made the detail schedule including renting the car,
the air ticket and hotel or motel, whatever everything is on the paper. We were
happy accept the invitation, Hurry up for visa first, due to three months left only.</font></span></p><font face="&#x5B8B;&#x4F53;" size="4">

Tiger&#x2019;s heart attack again, he must be has the operation immediately, one week
later, the minimally surgery was done for Tiger in An Zhen hospital which is
one of good hospital in China, everything was not bad, only we were worry about
Tiger can be suffering the long trip after the heart operation, if we postpone
or cancel that we will not be wish, but if we insist on it, if something
happened, even we have checked the medical insurance how we can ask for helps
if something happened during the trip. The doctor said it should be no problems
for the trip if no some urgent cases, takes it easy. Finally I put down my
heart gradually.</font></span></p><font face="&#x5B8B;&#x4F53;" size="4">
