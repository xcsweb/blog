A college in Sichuan has given its faculty and
student body a six-day
spring holiday for enjoying flowers and finding love. According to Wei Quanbin,
person in charge of the Southwest Aviation Vocational College of Sichuan, the
young and energetic students should be given enough leisure to feel the
exuberance of nature demonstrating only in this particular season and
experience the rising force of the new life. This activity can do them great
good both physically and psychologically. While they go sight-seeing, they should be aware of the preciousness
of springtime. And their youth is just as precious and transient as
spring, they must prize it, otherwise they'll regret their negligence afterwards.
