The name we sharePerhaps somedayWhen the happy people look back upon the
vicissitudes of lifeIn the growth rings of the republicCannot be seen your tired looksPerspiration, warm blood, tears and even
sacrificeAll the memory of youWill be gone with timeAmong the honors list engraved on the monumentThere is no word about you eitherSo you seem to disappear without traceAt the end of the time tunnelIn obscurity foreverHowever, I, only I,
deeply understandThe radiance of your
former resplendent accomplishmentCan still match up to
that of the sun  Your unforgettable
idealKeeps surging in my
mindUnder the unshakable banner
of your unfinished causeI’m determined to live
up permanently to your expectationWe both knowLoyalty is the same
name of us











































Which transfers from
one generation to another without end
