This evening, it started raining again. The umbrella I have always had it in the briefcase, so I did not care too much and just took it out and went all the way to the subway station.The weather does not stop the enthusiasm for the stock market. The Shanghai and Shenzhen index has soared greatly from yesterday. We really never know when it rises and when it falls. But we know the preparation we can make in advance just like the way I do on the umbrella. It could be clumsy to take the umbrella all the way, but it works when it rains. We have to be ready otherwise we can hardly seize any of chances we might have. If not, we may have nothing even in the potential bull market.
