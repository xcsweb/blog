Today's showers have almost satisfied
the needs of the thirsty sprouts of green beans planted at the backyard. The soil
close to the roots had been dry and couldn’t be soaked through by my watering. 

Yesterday, Ms Liu, a close neighbor of
ours, came to see mother long after her last visit for mother coming down. She chatted
on and on endlessly. I was quite annoyed by her disturbance to my quiet life. I
hoped her to leave as soon as possible for I had an urgent writing task to
finish. But I had to pretend to talk to her intimately.
