    Asked IT to repair the internet connection of the lab yesterday,  and I can do my daily work in the lab now.     The lab has a bigger area than our GM's office and only three equipment there. The most important is that it always silent. I can't stand the gossip of the office women any more . The talk always about shopping, food, pop stars and small household affairs and it may last all day. A girl even can talk with herself about all her work.  Maybe that's the generation gap or I am getting elder.  I prefer to bury myself in my work in a silent environment. Or I talk some meaningful topics for me with my colleagues occasionally , such as history, economic, culture, and so on.     I know it's not good for disappearing from office for a long time.  But the silent environment is a important thing for me. May be I will stay in office sometimes to show my exist.
