I postponed finishing my diary yesterday until now because it had been too late at night when I returned to the flat and moreover I felt a little tired. 
Towards the end of work hours, our vice-principal informed us to be off today for the coming heavy rain caused by a typhoon. The higher authorities are considerate in this respect. Then I can avoid being bedraggled.
My traveling expenses were reimbursed higher than expected. 
The brightness of the road lamps near the high buildings on my way has restored recently, under which we can read books. But in the past period they were very dim or even gave out no light at all. Â
