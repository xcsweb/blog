<p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" .="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:" microsoft="" yahei="" ui",sans-serif;="" color:black;mso-themecolor:text1"="">Software quality assurance is not equal to
software testing, but on many occasions, people always confuse them. For
example, some companies recruit software test engineers and others publish
these jobs as QA/QC engineers. How could we define the responsibility of QA? I
think QA is the person who tell the whole team how about the quality of our
products in every steps.</span></p>

<p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" .="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:" microsoft="" yahei="" ui",sans-serif;="" color:black;mso-themecolor:text1"="">To assess the quality of a product, it is necessary
to define important quality indicators for the software process and the
product. For example, bugs in the smoke test show the quality on the submitting
step, number of bugs per 1000 code lines give developers advices to improve
their developing quality. </span></p>

<p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" .="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:" microsoft="" yahei="" ui",sans-serif"="">Thus,
software quality metrics are the basis of software QA, which helps us know
current product and process quality and gives us clear goals to improve them. Before
setting about doing concrete testing tasks, it is better to spend some time on
measuring the quality of product and process. It is crucial to understand priorities
of all kinds of testing tasks. </span></p>

<p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" .="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:" microsoft="" yahei="" ui",sans-serif"="">With
clear aims and efficient ways to improve, testing will become more efficient
and valuable.</span></p>
