    Time, time... It is taught me many things.  some things we thought didn't exist, we come to discover there're actually real. But somethings we firmly believe in, after some time we find out , they never existed at all.  Like what ? ...    when I was a child, I would grow up quickly , in order to make money to change all of what I would wanna get or own. After some time I find out, I have lost lots of things ,although I have got some what I wanna look forward.     when I was at school or campus, I've hated studying with heavy homework, but just wanna go to play without sorrow and anxiety. Several years passed, I go into the society campus, I am jealous of the my child's time that I could learn knowledge, read any books, get along well with school-mates without abandon or fear of boundaries.    Future is always coming to me after the today,  and I am running in my line, as time goes on. Well... I did everything I could, I do everything I can, and then I will do everything I would.
