It had been forecast we would have a thunder shower today. Towards noon a sudden shower came down but no thunder was heard. 
The new highway under construction across the concrete road we take every day to work is based so low that it is just like a ditch. The intersection has been excavated to the level of the new road. So now we had to cross a dry trench there. 
The leaning enclosing wall east of the school gate has been torn down. The corn-stalk bundles I had stacked and covered at the southeast corner of the schoolyard were in the way. They have been thrown away and dispersed.
