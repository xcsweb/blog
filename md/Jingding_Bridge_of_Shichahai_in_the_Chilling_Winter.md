As early as more than ten years ago, I stepped on the land of the most promising city, Beijing, in the northern China. Shichahai has been the most approachable and comfortable scenic spot. It is very near to the central axis of from Drum Tower to Qianmen, and also free to tourists. However, all my previous trips were spent in summer with gentle breeze and green tree, and no sightseeing took place in winter. Thus, I decided to try a different experience. The willow tree seemed to be dry and withered with dangling branches in the chilling air. On the distant stone arch bridge there was a little travelers. It unfolded a different picture from that in spiring and summer: heavy, gray and cold. I chose to stand against the rail of Wanning Bridge to take a full and front picture.   It is a right and full picture of Jinding Bridge.  Among many bridges in Shichahai, the most famous is Yinding Bridge, it quenched my thirst to pay more attention to other bridges for a long time. Different
from Yinding Bridge that ever ranked one of Small Yanjing Eight Attractions, Jingding
Bridge never took place until 2001 when a bridge was built in the eastern outlet
of Shichahai lake. Hou Renzhi, the professor in Peaking University, was
assigned to give a name to the new bridge. Considering the necessary to be popular
and align with the scenery of Shichahai, Hou advised to name the bridge as
Jingding Bridge, Jingding means “golden ingot”,which corresponds to Yinding (sliver
ingot).     The setting sun crept over the tip of willow branch, setting off a bleak and drear picture in the royal garden. Many times, I  marveled at how magnificent the setting sun in the Forbidden City, while I still felt another kind of grandeur here.
