If you come to visit the Imperial Palace,
remember not to take pictures at these spots within for they will make your
flesh creep even by day. 

如果你要来参观故宫，记住故宫这几个地方是不宜拍照的，这几个地方白天在那里都会让人不寒而栗。Never photograph at the bedrooms of the
imperial concubines in the Cold Palace for too much yin there, otherwise you'll break the
taboo. 

在这种冷宫中妃嫔寝室是绝对不能照相的，这是故宫不宜拍照之中阴气最重的地方，要不然真是会犯了大忌讳...
