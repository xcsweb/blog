It seems inconceivable that sometimes a predator shows mercy and love to its prey. When I taught biology, I had ever seen one of the illustrations in the textbook, which recorded how a bird fed a fish in a pond regularly. According to the reference book, the bird probably had just lost her baby and then took the fish as a substitute. Another special case similar to this one happened in the documentary played on TV today. A lioness rescued a baby gnu just born from the hunting hyenas. She kept the vulnerable young company for some time and then took her departure. The puzzled mother had to stand far away watching anxiously before reuniting with her baby.
