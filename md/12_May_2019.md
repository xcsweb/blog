It's high time to install the gauze door again for
keeping the flies out.

Hearing tomorrow is rainy, I bought some
eggplant sprouts this morning when going to purchase tofu. 

Now I can make steamed bread successfully. I
don’t bake pancakes any more. 

The Historical Records written by Sima Qian
on the Shang Dynasty had ever been thought as legends before they were verified
by the inscriptions on the unearthed relics of that dynasty at Yin Ruins by the
end of the nineteenth century. This historical classic is mostly based on facts.
We cannot deny that a small proportion of legends may be inserted in it.
