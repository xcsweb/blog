A fine day. Rode my new bike to school. Took the shortcut of the dirt path on my return. And it was dry and passable. 
Mr W bought us some muskmelons. I took one and went to the printing room eating. Somehow, he didn’t even take a bite. 
Another round of maintaining schoolhouses and construction has begun. The outside walls close to the ground were being plastered with cement. The front playground of dirt seems to be covered with concrete for many bags of cement have been stacked beside it. Then the flow of the rain water wouldn’t make any ravines on it.
