This family trip was totally plan by my daughter at
two months ago with her friends, 7 days trip for one place was long time, but I
don’t like travels that were always on the bus. We started off at Sep 2 early
morning with small baby by plane, almost 5 hours from T3 to Phuket airport. As
order from Lazy Cat agency to pick us up to the hotel on time, so we had very
good beginning for this family holiday.

We were early one day come to Thailand than my
daughter’s friends, they will only arrive at the second day. The hotel named is
Duangjett resort near the sea, I can see it is the nature park with many kinds
of tropical plants and flowers which I hardly call the name, because of the
hotel is so big, from the lobby to the room we have to call the bell service sent
us by the trolley bus, I cannot believe it is only four stars hotel. If in
China, it must be six or seven stats service and maybe never happened. So in Southeast
Asia countries, the guest was treated like a king or queen, that’s why the most
of European likes spenting the holiday in Asia.

So the first day trip to Egg island like daily tour I
just like a follower, no any clue how far it was, how dangerous it was? Due to
just at one month ago, the ship with 80 peoples was an accident in this area,
PeiPeiPei, just forget it, we bring the sun glasses, the cap and swimming suit
to pick up the car. The weather was not too bad, a little sunshine in the
morning, so we did not take much clothes for the baby. When we went there, we
realized in fact the big ship cannot be pulled in to shore, all the customs
have to move other small boat, and then getting through a floating bright to
shore which is about 30 meters long. It will be continued.
