	Hi, March, after almost a month of continuous showers, heavy or light, I find myself loggy, lazy and even a little depressed while on the other hand, sometimes unable to control my anger, always having an impulse to shout or yell at others and what's worse, usually feeling regretful after those outrageous acts. What is the matter with me?  Maybe, it's because spring is  the air, haha! 	I shared this feeling personally with one of my coworkers, who coincidentally had the same experience last week,  and told me that he had already found an outlet for his confusing anger. What about you, friends? Are you all right or undergoing the same puzzle like me?
