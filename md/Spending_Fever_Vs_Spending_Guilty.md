 My husband lost his mind and he was
gripped by a helpless spending fever. And that culminated when he dragged me to
shopping last Sunday. He bought himself T shirts and another two sports pants---this
is ridiculous! I mean, I can understand if he bought some formal dress, but sports
again, seriously? First, he can’t do sports. Second, he can’t wear that to
work. So, is he going to change every a few hours during the weekend—for fun? I
tried to be supportive and considerate. I knew that he’s made some money out of
the stock market lately, and I knew it was kind of compensatory buying because
he hadn’t shopped for quite a long time after he got ill. But still I felt my
heart was bleeding. And then against my will, he bought me Nike outfit for
running, T-shirt, shorts and shoes, a whole set. It was supposed to cheer me up.
Finally, I have something great to wear for running. However, when I tried to
ignore the price tag, I failed. So all the time, that figure along with the mantra
of minimalism and less is more all swirled together in my mind. And this is not
the end. One day later, I received this package and my hand started trembling.
He bought me a Huawei P30pro! Oh, my I really didn’t know that to say. Of
course, I always wanted a cell phone like P30, with its camera, it’s big
screen, and everything. But how could I deal with this burning anxiety and
guilty of spending? Unsurprisingly, my eyelid became red and all swollen. If
you asked a doctor, he would told you that I had an allergy attack. But I’ve
already discovered that  if I was under some
mental distress, something physical would go wrong. That's when I realize that I am in a serious problem. I mean, if
shopping isn’t a pains killer but an anxiety trigger instead. What’s fun of
that?
