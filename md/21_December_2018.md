Tomorrow is the beginning day of Winter Solstice, a day with the shortest period of daylight and the longest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. This day comes on the twenty-first or either of the following two days of the twelfth month by the Chinese lunar calendar, when the sunlight shines straight down on the southernmost latitude it can reach directly, the Tropic of Capricorn. At this time the northern hemisphere only gets half the sunshine the southern hemisphere receives. The closer to the north, the shorter the daytime. The shadows cast by the sun turn the longest of the year.
