In the remaining of 22 days until I go back to UK, I have to use the time wisely to improve myself. Thus, time management seems vital to me. I always afraid of certain matters, such as pain in my period, and future life in my university：How to communicate with local student, how to make new friends, etc.Having said that, although I am worrying about unhappened things, I am still a brave guy, I believe that I will have a brilliant future if I pursue and work for it. Because I am a lucky girl as always.I put in my best effort to pass today, and I will continue to do it in my future days, because I have already realized the strong power of insisting.Good night and sweet dreams everyone.God loves us and god bless.Every hardworking and virtuous one will be lucky !!Dee20/08/2018Ningbo
