Again the haze is warping up the whole city. The land can not purify it by itself. It only depends on the wind and rain to clean up the mess in the air. How ironic it is. Where are the greens? And the rate of disease related to respiratory system obviously is increasing greatly. Even lung cancer is not rare to hear of.Being in that circumstances is equivalent to staying in a smoking room. Some guys, especially for those who are allergic to dust or have the problem of rhinitis, have to wear a mask to go out. Here it is the thing, how much does a mask can help?
