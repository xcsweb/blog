Meiyu as the transliteration of a typical Chinese rainy season has already lasted for one week. Even now, I can hear the sound of rain. This time with high humidity and stuffiness, precautions of mildewing preventing is a must. It is also the time for the harvest of wax berry. I had some shared from a colleague today. That is enough for me to have a taste. Because of the rain, I have canceled some nights of jogging. Last month I had finished 100 km in total. This month I assume it will be no more than 60 km. As long as I run, I freely relax myself on the way. And I keep a better figure and have successfully lost some weight. The rain is unpredictable. It rains all of a sudden and stops without any signs. The best way is to bring the umbrella at any time in case it unexpectedly rains.
