<div><font size="3"><font face="Verdana">Again, students go back to school today. It also reminds me of the time I went to school for first time. That was great time studying at school. After graduation from the college, I started to realise it is quite different from what I&#xA0; learnt from school. <br></font></font></div><div><font size="3"><font face="Verdana"><br></font></font></div><div><font size="3"><font face="Verdana">In practice, experience gained by hardship on work. Meanwhile it is hard to focus to read, study after work, since I am oppcupied by the petty things and sometimes even exhausted. One day, I told myself that I should not continue this kind of lame life. In order to start the new life, I began to change myself. I stepped out and made the decision to run around. I could hardly breathe. The image of vicotry encouraged me to proceed with the rest way to finish off. I forced myself to read. I did not like books at a very young age, now I get the importance of reading. Those who are fond of books never feel it a problem to read a book whether it is a long story or not. <br></font></font></div><div><font size="3"><font face="Verdana"><br></font></font></div><div><font size="3"><font face="Verdana">It is said the society is a school for everyone. What we learnt before is just part of the social school. Never too late to learn.<br></font></font></div>
