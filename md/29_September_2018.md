Asked permission for going to school late in order to draw some money from the bank. I don’t want to see him go empty-handed after spending his short holiday at home this time. 
Actually the National Day holiday has only three days and the two weekends close to it are added. 
It is said this winter the central heating system at school will be put into operation by using electricity instead of burning coal. Pollution can be greatly reduced in this way.
I just overheard Mr T is to make a wedding feast tomorrow. Up to now he hasn’t given us a formal invitation.
