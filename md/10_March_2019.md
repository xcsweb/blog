Some children are hostile to their parents.
They can hardly bear any criticisms. A little chagrin will trigger them to run
away from home or commit suicide in protest. They are particular about food and
clothing. They never do household chores. They leave their dirty clothes to
their parents or the laundry for washing. They squander money relentlessly as
if they were princes or princesses. They seem to have no good qualities. It’s ridiculous for the parents to
lay their high hope in these untamed youngsters. If they could keep away from
committing crimes and being fatally ill, their parents should feel lucky
enough. How can one expect such children to support and take care in one’s later life? Seeing the
disappointments of these parents, the childless couples will be relieved to
some extent.
