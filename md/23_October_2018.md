The poplar leaves have long turned yellow and begun to fall along the road to and from school. The rain last night brought down more leaves to the roadsides. Now only a small proportion of leaves cling to the twigs overhead. But soon the chilly wind and frost will detach them from the tree heads. Subsequently the trees are to be bare of leaves. On such a wet day in my sight were withered grass and fallen leaves. Once aged and weakened after the autumn of life, a man is not far from his grave as the grass and leaves will be buried by snow and rot quickly.
