The floating bridge was heavily moved, you cannot
stand walking smoothly, and there was no handrail, so hardly to move, anyway a
little by a little my family were the safe to the shore. 

Egg island was not officially opened, due to it was
not easy to find the way for the strangers or guests, the entrance was very
small out of the way, that’s why there is not so many people there, the sea
view is very nature and fresh, and the sand is clean and tidy, there are many small
tropical green fish, you can see it clearly in the sea, this place is very good
for the children’s family and also very good for the snorkel dive.

The weather was not too bad, the sunshine was not
strongly with some cloudy as well, the babies for sure they were starting to
play sands with the colourful toys, our adults were swimming and photo shooting
do what we like leisurely. 

Suddenly the black cloudy was covered the whole sky,
the heavily rainy was coming strongly, we were no time to pick our things
together, Holding the baby hurriedly to the poor shed, you know the shed at the
sea side, it was only a few wooden tables and plastic chairs, the ceiling was
leakage everywhere, my daughter was holding the baby with wet bath towel at the
corner of shed, we cannot find any safe places, we asked the local people how
long the raining can be stopped, they said it was hardly to say, but it was
very normal changed the weather like the baby face, after 15 minutes, the
raining did not stop, I thought we had to move and find other place for the
baby, otherwise I was afraid fear the children, we moving to the other place
which was more bigger space and no leakage, I knew my daughter was little worry
about the baby, she kept silent no any choice just pray the god.  

Finally the rain was a bit small, the tour guide said
we can leave here right now, everybody had to through the floating bridge again
to the ship, because of the windy, the bridge was shaken heavily than the beginning,
there was a ship which was almost closed for the last guest, my daughter was in
front, she was holding the baby, she wanted to catch it, but her steps was hardly
move forward, I was holding the grandma at the back, the full picture likes a
flea for safety.

Anyway it was a kind of experience, luckily after we
were back to hotel with hot bath for the baby, he was good, no any
uncomfortable at that time, so we can make our next daily tour.
