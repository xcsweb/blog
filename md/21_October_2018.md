A 50-year old single mother killed her 17-year old son. How could this tragic event have happened? The juvenile had ganged up with some tough boys, smoking, drinking, gambling and fighting. Without any intention to earn a shilling, he just kept squandering his mother's savings, enjoying good food and wearing fashionable clothes. When his mother failed to hand enough money to him in time, he would smash the furniture to pieces, beat and scold his mother or set the bedding on fire. The pitiful mother lived in fear and trembling all day long. No longer able to contain herself, she stuck him on the head in his sleep and ended his life.
