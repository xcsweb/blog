One of my son’s homework is to read
Shakespeare during this winter holiday. Well, Shakespeare is probably a bit
difficult for a six-grade. Every time when he is reading it, he looks like he’s
drinking vomit, with his face crumpled up all together. Three days later I
decided to do something about it, so I told him that I’ll read the English
version with him, and then we can make reading journal together. Of course, I
didn’t realize what kind of troubles I put myself in when I was saying
that.  Half an hour later, I stared at
the first chapter of Hamlet, wondering if I’d thrown all the years of my
English learning into the air.  I know 98%
percent of the words, but I just don’t know what the hell they are supposed to
mean when they are putting together in this way.  It all goes like this: But to recover of us,
by strong hand. And terms compensatory, those foresaid lands. So by his father
lost. Okay, I read Shakespeare in Chinese many years ago, so I can make a
guess. I even understand a bit more why Shakespeare is Shakespeare, I mean, if
you read it out, it’s smooth like the water, with all the rise and fall---if
you are not trying to figure out its meaning. “Mum, how about we read Harry
Potter together?” my son implored, “I prefer to read a whole book of Harry
Potter than a page of Shakespeare.” I must admit it’s a great suggestion. But
the Mum part inside me refused and she’s very adamant on this. “No honey, you
know we can’t run away from this.” I heard myself saying, signed, I returned to
the mysterious world of Shakespeare.
