Yesterday we were informed on the WeChat to start working tomorrow as expected. This morning Mr N, our vice-principal, phoned me for the same matter in case of my ignorance. Reviewing the summer vacation that has come to an end today, I often occupied myself with house chores. It was hard to carry out my study plans while waiting on son and satisfying mother by fulfilling the tasks she assigned me. In the almost unprecedented heatwave, I couldn’t raise my spirits for study. In her unoccupied moments, mother would be in a bad mood. She would release her anger like erupting volcanoes time after time.
