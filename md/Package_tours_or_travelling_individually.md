standards, many people can afford a holiday by leaving their living place and
visiting those tourist attractions. But people choose different way so
travelling according to their own interests. Some people like travelling with
others, while others prefer travelling alone.</font></span></span></p>

inter-ideograph;line-height:23.0pt;background:white"><span .="tran"><span lang="EN-US" .="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><font size="4">Many people like joining package tour, because
during the trip they don&#x2019;t have to worry about finding the hotel to live in,
the place for meals, as well as the transportation. The guide will take care of
everything. Compared with package tour, travelling alone, will leave someone a
lot of inconvenience, such as getting accommodation for the night, buy the
return tickets. No need to waste the golden time to find the place for a new
city or country. It is freer for worry, but there are many disadvantages as
well, such as some of tours guides will take you to the factories or stores and
force you to buy certain produces you are unwilling to do it. Some of tour
groups get up early to catch the buses or trains, due to which are cheaper. One
thing I cannot accept the group leader has very bad attitude with some old man
and women guests, He/ She is lost patient to get on the bus or slow walk,
repeat and repeat, due to bad memories for them. Merely hearing and seeing
only.</font></span></span></p>

has the advantage that joining the package tour cannot enjoy. You are your
boss. You decide whether you like to climb up a mountain or to be driven up in
cable cars, and where to spend your time to linger a little longer to enjoy
yourself thoroughly. At the ten years ago, Tiger and I went to Europe for two
weeks by ourselves, before we left, we did the schedule carefully, maybe we can
speak well English, that may us more easy if we have the problems, we were
totally enjoy our time, we went to more than ten cities by bus, train or the
plane.</font></span></span></p>

enjoy great freedom. In addition, it is much convenient and not to tired than
the package tour. That&#x2019;s why as our age, not too old yet, I personally prefer travelling
alone. &#xA0;</font><span .="font-size: 15pt;"></span></span></span></p><p .="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:
