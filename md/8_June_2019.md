A five hundred-character poem on the trip from the
capital to a county city named Fengxian 

自京赴奉先縣咏懷五百字I'm a civilian from Duling. I tend to be out of accord with
the times as I get older.  

杜陵有布衣，老大意转拙。How ridiculous I am to liken myself to Ji and
Xie！

許身一何愚，竊比稷与契。As a result, I've accomplished nothing.
Nevertheless, I'm still willing to be industrious in spite of my old age.  

居然成濩落，白首甘契闊。
As long as I live, I will hope to realize my
ideal. 


盖棺事则已，此志常覬豁。
