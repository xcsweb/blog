You need to be happy to fight against the cancer.
Actually, it’s not some crazy story, but on the contrary it’s a scientific theory.
You see, when you are happy, your body create some chemistry which will boost
your immune system, and your immune system plays a critical role, it is your
most important weapon to win this battle. 

 

But it’s paradox. Cancer, after all, is not
something pleasant. You have to go to the hospital every day, a place always
over-crowded and filthy. You get in a long, long line to have your whole body
scanned, CTed and MRIed; you sign the papers which remind you of the worst
consequence of every check, like death; you are surrounded with cancer patients
and you see fear, despair, anger, weak, and suffering in every face. Of course,
and there is the pain following you everywhere. It’s easier to handle it when
you are misdiagnosed. I mean, what’s the big deal about inflammation? But now, you
know it’s helpless cry from your body under the attack of cancer, which is
ruthless multiplying and tearing your life apart. 

 

And I’m just talking about the first phrase,
which is relatively the easier part. 

 

You see, it’s really hard to feel happy
under such circumstance. Still, there are some tips. 

 

First of all, imagination. Every time when I
laid down in CT or MRI machine, I imagined myself in a space craft—you have to admit
there are some similarities. I imagined next minute, I would be transferred to
a faraway galaxy where I was going to fight with some monster. It relieved me from
anxiety every time. Or you can just close your eyes, summoning the best moments
of your life. 

 

Sometimes, if it’s really hard to be happy,
you can transfer all your fears, frustrations, and sufferings into a sort of
anger, a deafening inner cry: “I WILL NOT DIE LIKE THIS”. 

 

Trust me, it helps.
