Teachers' Day 
All teachers and students left school for home after lunch. Recently every lunch at school we have been offered cooked ears of tender maize. The glutinous corn seeds were sown at different times so that we can continuously eat tender ears which are welcome in this season. Sometimes I saw some of my colleagues picking several ears carrying home for the eating at school was not sufficient for them. Our principal also sent them to his counterparts and village chiefs as a present. With a particular flavor, the roast corn ears sell well in the street after nightfall. Â
