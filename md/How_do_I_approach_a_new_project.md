<p .="MsoNormal"><span .="font-family: " microsoft="" yahei="" ui",="" sans-serif;="" font-size:="" 14pt;"="">When
approaching a new project or working in a new team, the first thing worth to do
is having a user mindset. Trying to use our product as a customer and create
user&#x2019;s dataset help me understand what values the product deliver to users and what
the main pain point is when using our product.</span></p>

<p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" .="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:" microsoft="" yahei="" ui",sans-serif"="">After
having users&#x2019; mindset, it&#x2019;s time to get an understanding of what is going on
and learn the architecture of our product. I need to know the whole software
process and what our team&#x2019;s main task during the SDLC. </span></p>

<p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" .="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:" microsoft="" yahei="" ui",sans-serif"="">Getting
a complete insight into my team is also a high-priority task, including
reviewing any automated test scripts, reading product documents and
specifications. Then I can define to what extent our test engineers can add
value for the entire process. </span></p>

<p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" .="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:" microsoft="" yahei="" ui",sans-serif"="">It
is crucial to setting up quality metrics for the product and SDLC, such as measure
bugs number per 1000 code lines and rate of the bug-fixed, shipping delay rate,
etc. After getting the current quality data, we can get down to list the tasks
we should do and set priorities for them.</span></p>

<p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" .="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:" microsoft="" yahei="" ui",sans-serif"="">To
summarize, understanding what is critical for our system under test is important,
do not dive into details too early.</span></p>
