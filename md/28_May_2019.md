I didn’t arrive at the Second Primary School
attached to the Northeast Normal University until 10 o'clock although I had started
off since after 6 o'clock. I was sent there attending the lectures on calligraphy by
some famous teachers. The first thing I did was to sign in. In the morning I sat
in on three classes; in the afternoon I visited two more. All lectures were
about the techniques of brush writing and all teachings chose Ouyang Xun's works as models
for copying. The stroke consisting of vertical, then curved and finally hook
ones was first analyzed and taught by a woman teacher. Another teacher stressed
that every character has its primary part and secondary section.
