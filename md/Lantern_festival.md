Lantern Festival is the fifteenth day of the first
month of lunar year, and the last day of Spring Festival, the people would like
enjoying the glorious full moon and decorating the colourful light in the
evening, eating sweet dumpling at home, making the day to other high remark.

There are many greetings and different colour pictures
or the flash by friends and other groups from Wechat for celebrating of the day.
This morning Beijing is covered with snow luckily, even it is not too much, but
it is telling us it is good beginning of this year. When I was out to fitness
at the hazy moonlight, I took the picture by cell phone involuntarily to record
the beautiful moment in our nice community.

Surely at the day Tiger must be visiting his father, the
phone call is not good enough to show his loves at this important day. We will
have a lunch with his father at his home. In the morning, after breakfast, I
thought what I can brought some foods for his father, I knew any other foods
buying from supermarket is not so unique, I checked with our Ayi that Pork
Jelly salad which is home made by Ayi is still available, it is not so oily and
very delicious, You know it is much better for old people. His father likes
Sauce Pigâ€™s feet so much and Roast Duck, we went to the restaurant near our
home made dish order for those two. 

I carried a few big food bags to his home, Ayi has
waited us with her speciality vegetarian dishes for the long time. How happy of
his father after he saw us, I know any good foods cannot instead to face to
face and touching the feeling, his happiness is hard to tell, especially at
this day we went home to see him was very important, everything is worth to do
for him. We all wish his health forever. 

How nice Lantern Festival we had !
