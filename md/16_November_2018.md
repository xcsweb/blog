The coldest day up to now in this winter. It was dirty yesterday because of the sleety weather. The road surface got muddy for the fallen snow flakes melted immediately as they touched it. When I cycled home, I found my lower trouser legs had been spattered with mud spots. Later at the flat I also saw slurry specks on the back of my jacket and headgear. The protruding back fender is too short to block the mud flung up by the quickly revolving wheel. The old bike has not this flaw. Next time in such circumstances, I must lengthen the back fender before cycling.
