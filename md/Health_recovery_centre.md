The time was so fast, I have looked after a patient by
staying with Tiger in Health recovery centre for 10 days. Since He resisted the
operation for his waist, after we got the good advice by a very famous doctor, and
we don’t want to take any risks for the operation, even we knew some good
doctors or professors in medical field. So at the last, the conservative treatment
was the way at the moment we told after they read the reports from his unclear
magnetic.

Introduced by his sister, we came to Health recovery
centre where is located at the west part of Beijing, it is health resort near
the mountain, the place is not too big with a few buildings, a covered antique corridor
with a colourful painting, like a gallery, the different green pine trees
making is like a park, many of people can take the walk with long corridor, you
can see many of wheel chairs at the corner to take the sunshine from the
morning to the evening, very quiet to enjoying the sunset, it is really
beautiful place you can relax totally.

We lived a suite at third floor with two beds with the
sunshine, Luckily we are VIP guests as they said, order the dishes as per menu
one day in advance, at the next day the girl is taking the food to your room directly,
Like Room Service, very convenient for living there. Each shift of nurses would
come to your room say hello to each room before starting their works. Very curtsey
and helpful.  

Tiger goes to the treatment centre for almost two hours
every morning and afternoon including Wax nursing, physical treatment, hot compress
bag and traction therapy, in order to get well soon, Tiger took it very
seriously and follow the instruction for each items carefully.

I was fully in charge his accommodation including his eating,
cleaning and sleeping during these days, I like calling myself a baby-sitter 24
hours totally. A common vision for us like him relaxing during the time. As we
all know it needs the time at least three months recovery smooth in bed as much
as you can, don’t be worry, there is no short tips for the separate part of body.

This weekend we have checked out the hospital, the
nurses and doctors were all very kind and good service they had, they all came
to see good bye to us and they were standing one side when we were leaving. I
am the hoteller, so it is a really five star hospital service I have never seen
before. We had a good time during my stay.
