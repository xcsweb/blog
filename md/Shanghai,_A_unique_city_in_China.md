I have been to many modern cities in the world
including Shanghai, Frankly speaking If I have the time for the holiday,
Shanghai for sure is not my first choose, I don’t like Shanghai city much. Not because
of it is the harbour city, the weather is hot in summer, even it is one of modern
and updated one than others. People from Shanghai are not so openly when they
are doing something; it is my personal idea only, sorry for saying that. I am
from Beijing, some of Beijingers don’t like Shanghai citizens including me, I
don’t know why? Maybe it is hardly understand dialectal accent. 

China has many famous cities. Beijing, the capital of
China, is the centre of politics, because it is where the central government
located. In the mid-west, Chongqing, another municipal city, is also the centre
of most forms of transport, but people in the world are always impressed by the
most distinctive city in China – Shanghai. Which is also be called the oriental
pearl.

All in all, Shanghai should definitely be counted as
one of the great cities in China. It is where two different cultures meet,
therefore. It has charming characteristics both in city planning and human
communication. As it is the national business centre as well as the East Asia,
Shanghai can always attract the attention from all over the world, enjoying the
ultimate advantages of further development. The graduated students would like
finding the first job in Shanghai to realize their potential. The owners would
like to buy the house in the big city including SH. For all these reasons,
Shanghai is a city that highlights the eastern part of China.

In conclusion, Shanghai is an important city in China,
and people should consider is as such, It has unique atmosphere for business,
entertaining or experiencing cultural exchange, Its fascinating combination of
traditional Chinese culture and latest and most advanced technology will make
anyone all in love with it.
