The weather forecast can be easily inquired on the Internet. And I needn’t wait for the report after the CCTV News every evening. Then I can leave our bungalow early after supper for the flat. Moreover I manage to finish my diary by day rather than at night for retiring in time. This may ensure me to rise not too late next day.
Yesterday evening I found some bottled highly toxic pesticide named deltamethrin in the small cardboard boxes picked by mother from the rubbish pit nearby when I removed them to the shed in case it might rain. It gave off an aggressive and intolerable smell. I warned mother to stay away from those things in the future. 
Cycled to school in the drizzle. Thanks to the spare clothes I had brought from home, I could change the wet pants and socks for the dry ones.
