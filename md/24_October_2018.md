Last night when I returned to our flat, I felt a little warmer than usual. It seemed as if the heating supply has started. Then I made an examination of the first part of the heating pipe in the kitchen, it didn’t felt cold any more. Moreover I needn’t put on any heavy coat near the balcony for keeping warm. At school Mr Y confirmed my assumption. In the meantime, I saw the blue truck carry coal to the boiler room again. Our school’s central heating system has been put into operation. Tonight at our apartment I have to take off parts of my clothes on account of the high temperature.
