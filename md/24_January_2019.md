After such a long separation, my clothes
have turned baggy.

相去日已逺，衣帶日已緩。
The floating clouds blot out the sun. The migrating
man has no intention to return. 

浮雲蔽白日，遊子不顧返。
Longing for you quickens my ageing. Now the
end of the year is approaching. 

思君令人老，歳月忽已晚。
I will say no more. Take good care of
yourself. 

棄捐勿復道，努力加餐飯。
