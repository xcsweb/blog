After I grew up, I worked hard for my ideal
And gradually ignored parents and home.
Now I'm seemingly acting in a play,
Speaking insincerely with a false appearance.
I'm inclined to deceive myself 
By showing some insignificant achievement.
I always unaccountably feel a sense of emptiness. 
I won't fall asleep if not tipsy.
