<p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="4">Another busy day slipped by. I am supposed
to have a laid-back life, to have a lot of time to rest. But supposed is a
trick word and you never know. </font></span></p><p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="4">&#xA0;</font></span></p><p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="4">Here&#x2019;s my schedule for today and you can
say it has nothing to do with laid-back. <span .="mso-spacerun:yes">&#xA0;</span></font></span></p><p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="4">&#xA0;</font></span></p><p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="4">Get up at 6:30, prepare breakfast, and then
drive my son to school. Spend two entire hours in tidying up the rooms. Considering
the fact that I had five days in hospital, and I have to say that is a hell of lot
work. Do the laundry, prepare and have lunch. </font></span></p><p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="4">&#xA0;</font></span></p><p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="4">Then I go to the bank and the community
service center to prove one thing: I can&#x2019;t afford my hospital bills and I need
help. Really it&#x2019;s a simple math problem and even a primary school student can
tell that my family income is less than my hospital bills. Besides, when I started
my THP therapy, my doctor told me that if I paid 9 perjeta and I could get 10
for free. Nobody mentioned that &#x201C;free&#x201D; requires of an extremely complicate
process, which like the hospital, the insurance company, refuses any kind of reasonable
simplifying, even just for a simple math problem. This process involves my company,
my husband&#x2019;s company, community service, the bank, my parents, Civil office bureau,
department of housing management&#x2026;. </font></span></p><p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="4">&#xA0;</font></span></p><p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="4">So, that&#x2019;s just a start. BTW, I haven&#x2019;t got
my request approved by the community service, because the person in charge was
on a meeting. <span .="mso-spacerun:yes">&#xA0;</span></font></span></p><p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="4">&#xA0;</font></span></p><p .="MsoNormal"><span .="font-size: large;">Now when I finally come home, I have daily
learning to finish, dinner to prepare, a son to pick up, homework to check&#x2026;.</span></p>

<p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="4"><br></font></span></p><p .="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="4">Time always rushes by in the hustle and bustle of life,&#xA0; anyway, anytime and anyhow.&#xA0;&#xA0;</font></span></p>
