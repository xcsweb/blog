The moon in the cloudless night sky is very bright and perhaps the brightest in the whole year. It is just like a natural lamp illuminating the world below. Tonight it can replace the road lamps to light the streets. Moreover, this night is beautiful and poetic. It has been written into numerous poems in different dynasties. It is endowed with life and passion by the poets. It can be taken as a companion accompanying the solitary poet. And it acts as the intermediary agent for two or more close friends or relatives separated. Then I decide not to draw the curtain over the bedroom window this night so that we can gaze at each other.
