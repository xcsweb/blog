It took Ms L about two hours to drive four of
us colleagues to S Primary School attending the lectures of several subjects. There
we first heard an admirable speech made by the school principal. Then I was
ushered to a calligraphy class with some visiting counterparts from other
schools as assigned. Before the small young teacher conducted his class, an
address of welcome was given by a girl in Chinese and by a boy in English. Afterwards
we listeners gathered with the lecturer and two chiefs concerned in another
room for a discussion. I just kept silent listening to others' opinions. Â
