To sort rubbish into different bins is such a headline. Not only in cities in Beijing and Shanghai, but also in more cities will carry out regulations according to which people are asked to deal rubbish correctly with right bins, or they are likely to be fined. This on some level does help us to cultivate a good habit and we are not to throw everything we consumed easily. Compared to fine, advocation of encouragement is much more effective. By doing so, positively, it can let people realize the importance of environment protection. Those who perform well can be awarded with something by the record of their good deeds. For example, supermarkets can deliver coupons to customers who are with credible record in environment protection. This is the project made by public and done by everyone. Therefore we can do it well in almost every public business.
