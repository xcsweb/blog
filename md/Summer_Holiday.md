    This Saturday, my wife will go back to her hometown with our kids, normally, they will go back home once a year. Since our daughter enters primary school, they have to choose the summer holiday as the best opportunity to go back hometown because of much longer holidays, the direct distance is not too far, if they take high-speed trail as transportation, three hours is enough. But, the tough problem is that they need to transfer a big bus to go home after getting off train. When my daughter was a little girl, I will accompany my wife to go back her hometown at public holiday, now, as my daughter grows up, she can go with her mother returning hometown, what's more, she is expected to have a happy time with her cousin. On the one hand, she can experience a different lifestyle that differentiates current lifestyles, on the other hand, she can experience the feeling of living in countryside then to enjoy the peace of countryside.    Anyway, hopefully they can enjoy a period of happy and colorful holiday in my wife's hometown.
