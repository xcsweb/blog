A child won't be happy unless his parents
are affectionate. A couple won't last long except that they are deep in love with each other. The senior
citizens won't feel relieved until they see their children living in a perfectly
satisfactory marriage. So the young or middle-aged couple plays a key role in
ensuring the welfare of the family by linking the minor with the senior. The couple
must bear responsibility for raising the young and supporting the old. Unfortunately,
more and more couples fail to carry out their duties, leaving their children
and parents alone. It is not that they have no time and money but for lack of
love.Â
