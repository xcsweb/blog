The school we visited yesterday is named
Shangde, which means to worship the virtues. In his speech, Mr Wang, principal
of the school stressed the importance of inheriting the traditional Chinese
virtues advocated by Confucianism. As a matter of fact, its motto is
benevolence, righteousness, courtesy, wisdom, trust, temperateness, kindness,
courteousness, restraint, magnanimousness. Calligraphy, a part of the
quintessence of Chinese culture, is offered as one of the compulsory courses in
the school. Some unnecessary subjects have been cancelled to make time for the
more important ones. The teachers in charge of the classes are demanded to
write a one-thousand-odd-character comment of each of their students by the end
of every term for delivering to the parents. So it's no wonder the school
enjoys widespread popularity.
