According to the weather forecast, temperatures will drop sharply in the next few days across the northern part of our country from northwest to northeast. The biggest drop is about 10 degrees centigrade in some areas. Some places in Xinjiang and Heilongjiang will even expect snow. The hard time of the year is to come. At first we'll feel somewhat uncomfortable with the change but soon we shall adapt to the severe weather. In fact winter benefits our health because we can sleep longer and work less than in other seasons. Compared with the southerners, the northerners have good health and a long life. The cold weather is really advantageous.
