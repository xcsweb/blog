As the saying goes, parents are the first
teachers of their children. But in the case recounted here, the parent and his
daughter switched their roles. The father was judged as a drunken driver, but
he denied it and lied to the police that it had been his nephew who had driven
the car. Because there was no other person in the car except the man and his
young daughter, then he continued to fool the police saying that his nephew had
just entered the construction site by the road for work. But the later inquiry
proved his words false. In the meantime, the little girl confessed to the police
that her father had driven the car after drinking wine. She also asked her
father in tears to tell the truth immediately. The father had often drunk alone
in depression since the divorce from his wife.Â
