No road lamps near the tall buildings illuminated my way back to the apartment this evening.
The 87th anniversary of the September 18 Incident when the Japanese troops began their invasion of northeastern China. On 18 September 1931, the Japanese accused the Chinese army of blowing off the railroad track near Shenyang after they did it themselves. The Chinese National Revolutionary Army retreated without any resistance giving up the northeast completely. The Republic of China fixed today for National Humiliation Day. We really shouldnâ€™t forget our humiliating history. And we must strengthen our national defense to avoid being bullied again.
