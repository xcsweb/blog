Winston Churchill once said NEVER GIVE UP, NEVER SURRENDER. With that will, the UK had mastered its own destiny and turned the table. It is true if we say no to difficulties, we have higher possibility to get what we want. If we just give it up easily, we may lose many chances. And many of those chances will come to your side as long as you can wait for one more minute meanwhile remain cool in mind. As an individual, it is the time to shoulder the responsibility and say that everything is going to be fine. Even though the process of being in success is full of hardship. Everything is deserved.
