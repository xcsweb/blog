The warm spell brought back throngs of flies indoors. 
Harvest season. Here in northeast, farmers began to get in their corn, cabbages and radishes. I suppose in my native country in north China it must be a different scene. The corn has long been reaped and the seedlings of winter wheat might have sprouted out in the fields now. The local people there maybe are digging up their sweet potatoes, storing the intact in the deep well-like cellars and drying the bruised by cutting them into pieces. The unforgettable interesting thing in my childhood  was to search for the remnants in the harvested plots and braise the thin ones on the spot.
