A thin layer of ice formed on the surface
of the water in the bucket and the fuels were covered with a heavy frost. I have
got used to the chill for the autumn has arrived so long. 

水浮冰兮薪覆霜，秋旣久兮已耐凉。People's lot is just like this, so I hope
my wound will cure with the passing of time. 

人生際遇亦如此，且待時日療我傷。
