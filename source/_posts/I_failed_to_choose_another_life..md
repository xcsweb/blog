We always&#xA0; have to be faced&#xA0; with different choices since we were borned.At in my view,making a good choice is difficute because we have to think many aspects for dealing with them.this time i lost my last chance to get PHD.One thing that i was considered is that my parents are getting&#xA0; older every day ,i am afried i cannot company them at their last time.Another thing is if i will go to a foreign university, i need&#xA0; spend at least five years in there,when i will come to our country,my age maybe will&#xA0; close fifty years old,which means it is a few years away from retirement. To be honest, i donot kown weather it is worth or not.However i really want to get a PHD in my life, it is my dream.My hunsband laughed at me recently,said i am an elder woman who have a beautiful dream,i should put the family first,after all i amnot young,i should persue my dream that time ,but not now.<div>Maybe he is right,i have thought this problem since last month,i regected an offer from a foreign school today,i will never become my dream.</div>
