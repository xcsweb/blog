It is easy to be lost, knowing nowhere to go. The main reason is that we think it too much and finally mess it up. It is not that easy to make judgement if there is no evidence to show the right decision. When it comes to face troubles, we do not exactly undersand that actions we make today is probably to make a big difference tomorrow. Of course, we do not know. That is the beauty of life.Be yourself, do not be a zombie. Do not admire somebody else, you are the best one with unique inner world. Time records your growth and makes the history.
