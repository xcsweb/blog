The snow has almost thawed out. The drizzle ended this morning. It is much colder and more like the winter. In the warm comforable bed, I find it hard getting up. After repeating to myself that I would be late to work, I got up unwillingly. On my way to the subway station, I was splashed by some muddy water from a pond nearby when a car just passed by. Dear lord. This unexpected experience made me not good. Because of the thinking on the mess of muddy spots on my clothes, I was so disattracted that I forgot my umbrella which was left on the subway. Dear lord again. It had accompained me for almost two years.The good news is those spots are not that strong. After cleanazing with some water, they are gone. Anyway I am bessed. By saying farewell to my dear umbrella, I should buy a new one.
