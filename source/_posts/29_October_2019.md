The sky has brightened after the night rain.
But some sections of the road were still muddy. I pedaled my trike towards school
with difficulty against the wind.    

雨後初晴猶泥濘，踏車容與迎風行。

I decided to push back home the trike load of
coal as early as possible, which I collected yesterday. 

昨日攢得煤幾許，趁早舉步推家中。
