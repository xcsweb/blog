We were invited to join in the wedding during National
Day at Shan Xi province. The boy and the girl are all from the same area at Shi
Lou county of Lv Liang city in Shan Xi山西, where is
the most poor mountainous area just next to Shan Xi 陕西. We
knew the boy when he was a little boy, due to he is very clever and hard work,
Tiger and I likes him so much and we would like him to be our adopted son, that’s
why his wedding for sure we would like to give him fully support.

There are four children in his family, the boy is the
third one and the last one for the married in his family, we did not think how
poor there is, they still live in cave house village which I only saw it in the
film that I cannot believe. Due to Shan Xi has many coal mine, that’s why there
are many big trucks on the way, the bad air pollution and the traffic are so dangerous
for the small car. His parents are all younger than me but they look like 60-70
years old, but smiling is so kind and honest I can see, they did not speak so
much when we came in to the courtyard, the body language I can read how happy
they were. According to the local custom, one day before of wedding, all the
villagers, neighbours and relatives have big dinner together gives the presents
as returns. At the time the local band with three or four people group were
invited as well for the celebration. There was a big red rubber arched door
attached name of the bride and the bridegroom. I was told there will be 300
more people for the dinner at the night, the chef and kitchen helpers was other
group were the most busiest for mess part, the people came for eating all
standing there, like running water, one after other, the big pail for food did
not like human foods I must say so, but still was gone in a few minutes. Any way
I cannot believe and I felt so sad. 

The second day morning the wedding was officially started
from 11am,Unhealthy custom there were more than 10 black Audi to pick up the bridge;
the bridegroom was holding the bridge over his shoulder with the string of firecracker
hard to walk, but he had to do like this. Tiger and were honoured to be the
chief witness coming to the stage, to showing our loves and wish they will have
a great future in the life. One thing was so attractive me till today was the
host asked the children and grandsons or granddaughters all went down on their
knees for the parents with the harmonious music, this picture was still in my
mind cannot take it away. 

This was a great wedding party I have never seen
before, let me learn a lot and to know there are many rural area like here in
China need us to help, to change the traffic situation and let them go out of
the mountain area.
