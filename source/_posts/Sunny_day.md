It becomes cooler and even cold. Winter is here to tell us that we really have to be sure and ready for it. Withered lotus leaves demonstrate another scene of its beauty.Around the living community, I see some delivery men busy dealing with piles of packages. Most of these packages are mainly ordered and purchased on 11.11.Â More than one month, 2018 comes to the end and more than two months is the spring festival is around the corner. Wow, it is fast as days go. My colleague says to me that next week she has to book the ticket to to go back home during spring festival. And she still does not know if she could order it. For those who work far away from home, it is a miserable thing.Every year it cycles as seasons change. We become elder, sophisticated and know more and harvest more. Maturity of life does not only represent the looking of a person, moreover, the mentality which is the ability to tell what everything around is. Experience helps a lot and we learn to be wise and rational.Today is nice with warm sunshine in daytime. In the afternoon, I make tea and drink it by looking into the sky. Most time of this month is rainy, even though the sky is not so blue, I still like the light since it brings me hope and happiness. What a sunny day.
