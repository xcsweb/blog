When I was young,
I would like to be alone on the seashore,
Rolling up my trouser legs
And stepping barefooted on the sands.
I would imagine the existence of another world by the end of the ocean,
Take the brave sailors for real men
And myself a coward too weak to withstand a gust of wind.
I used to hear the sailor say when bullied,
‘In the stormy life, this pain is negligible.
Don’t be afraid and wipe away your tears.
And don’t ask why.
At least we still have dreams. '
