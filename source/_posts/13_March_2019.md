With no shortage of food and clothing,
nowadays people are more and more enthusiastic about preserving their health. To
keep fit, besides good foods and outdoor activities, mental cultivation is also
important. Everyone hopes to be in a good mood every day. To reach this goal,
the best way is to adhere to the doctrines of Buddhism, abstaining from
avarice, annoyance and infatuation. That is to say, purifying the heart and
diminishing the passion. It’s easy to declare the belief but hard to carry it out. Because it
needs a strong will to resist all kinds of worldly temptations, which are just
illusions, as Buddhism denotes. Once into the state when all conventional
desires have been deserted, the joy repaid will be unmatched, well above that
brought by wealth, power and position.
