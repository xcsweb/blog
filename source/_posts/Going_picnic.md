Dragon Boat Festival is an ancient traditional
festivals, began in the Spring and Autumn period, which was originated from Qu
Yuan’s story. Also called the Duanwu Festival, is celebrated on the fifth day
of the fifth month according to the Chinese calendar, people always eat rice dumplings
and watch dragon boat races.

Three days holiday including the weekend of the
festival for this year, I suggested to my family going picnic in the park during
the holiday, due to the beginning of summer is not too hot, far away to crowd
people, and I have prepared the tent, the air pillow, outdoor chairs and tables
in advance, I believe this outdoor activity is happy for the child and released
the pressure for young mother and father. As expected my idea was really
welcomed.

The first day of the holiday was a nice day, it was not
too hot with a little cloudy, My family were going to Olympic park where was
not too far from my home, full of car with our stuffs including foods and
beverages, luckily we came more early, we found a very good place on green
grass of the ground, after confirmed with gardener where was allowed for
packing tent, everyone was busy for the new house, the new tent is much better
than my old one, it was easy to packing, the baby was playing his bike, my daughter
was making Sandwich, my daughter in law was fixing the tent, I was busy with
the folding chair and table, only Tiger was nothing to do, only waiting
everything was ready for his study. There were water melon, cherry, cucumber and
bread hand carry from home, Chicken feet with pickled pepper which is one of my
daughter favourite food I did it by myself.

The blue sky with a little white cloud, the green
grass, I took one sunhat to Tiger, the young parent was playing ball with the
baby, I was enjoying myself shooting, everything is relax and happy. How harmonious
feeling at the moment! We will come again for sure. Before we left there were more
families with their tent as well, I hope this kind of life can be taken longer
till the end of the world.
