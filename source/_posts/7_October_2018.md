The seven-day long National Day holiday has passed. Tomorrow, a black Monday, I'm to leave my warm home early and work at our chilly schoolhouse. From now up to the beginning of heating supply I have to bear the evening chill at our flat and the coldness at school. During this period our bungalow is very agreeable to stay for the cooking stove provides enough warmth for us daily. In the past few days when I felt tired and sleepy I could take a nap on the warm kang to refresh myself. However I have to put on more clothes for keeping warm when taking a rest at school.
