From time to time a volunteer propagandist would come to our school giving us teachers a lecture on safety or health. This afternoon before knocking off, we were called to gather in the classroom of Grade Five hearing another lecture on how to prevent fire and quell an unexpected fire. The lecturer was a tall, middle-aged man, who had been a firefighter for eight years. His voice was extremely loud and clear without showing any hoarseness and exhaustion. I think he must be a practitioner of abdominal breathing as a singer. His speech was very humorous and attractive. Finally he advertised a fire extinguisher for sale, which looked like a flashlight, very convenient for use in a private car or at the kitchen.
