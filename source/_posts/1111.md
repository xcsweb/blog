Since the introduction of Double Single Day on November 11th by Jack Ma from Alibaba Group becomes the online shopping banquet, every year in this special night most guys will spend time waiting for the sharp discount among items. It is the contest of time, energy and network. If you are with enough time, good energy and fast connection of internet, you do take the nice position to purchase some ideal things. The downside is many packages are about to be delivered for some days, usually between one to two weeks, or even longer. It comes at a price that we have to pay for the cost of congestion of express delivering. And then piles of piles packages would be stocking around, they are in living communities, office buildings and many other places. You will see deliverymen calling consignees and people coming to get their packages.I rarely buy things online. I only order some books. I am not easy to have something online out of impulse. Thus, I do not know what a feeling it will be like. But surely, there are many guys are already with their PCs or phones to wait for that time full of excitement.
