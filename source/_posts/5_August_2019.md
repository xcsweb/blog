Most people in the world are led astray by
the desire for external things. The essence of life is beyond their
comprehension. 

世人多為外物累，未解方内真滋味。I still cherish a feeling of reverence for
the recluse Tao in the Eastern Jin Dynasty. He was carefree and leisurely in
spite of extreme poverty and enjoyed his life without any regret. 

至今猶憶陶彭澤，悠然心逺死無悔。
