“A child’s future can be predicted,” as the old
saying goes.

我们有一句流传特别广泛的话是这么说的，“三岁看大，七岁看老”。

The critical period is
under age 3 for a child’s
formation of character and cultivation of ability. It is the kid’s companions and education in this period that
mold his or her character. 

孩子性格形成和能力培养的关键期就在3岁之前，这个阶段的孩子跟随什么样的人，接受什么样的教育，就将会形成相应的性格。

A strong impression
will be made on the children by the speech and deportment of the adults
accompanying them day and night.

和其朝夕相处的成人所说的每一句话，所做的每一个动作都可能会深深地烙在他们的心灵深处。Recently, at a barbershop in the Nanan District
of Chongqing, a customer surnamed Chen was dissatisfied with the service offered.
Then he had a terrific row with the barber, a Mr Li. He not only pushed and
shoved Li but pressed him on a chair giving him a reckless haircut before
leaving with satisfaction. 
近日，在重庆南岸区一理发店内，顾客陈某理完发后对服务不满意，随后双方发生了争执，陈某开始动手推搡李某，并一把他按在椅子上，用理发器在他头上一通乱剃后才心满意足地离开。
