A sunny day. Transplanted some seedlings of cabbages. Very comfortable evening with a bright moon in the broad starlit sky. There were countless unseen insects chirping relentlessly around reminding us of the approaching autumn. 
Around noon watched a film named Father and Son in which the well-known comedian Chen played the hero. Extremely interesting and revealing. 
Found a lot of asbestos shingles deserted beside the dustbins opposite to the gate of our housing estate, which are usable. Immediately I carried the intact tiles and the larger pieces into the compound where my apartment building is located. And I can build a lavatory with them behind our bungalow. Â
