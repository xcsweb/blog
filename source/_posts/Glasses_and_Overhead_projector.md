After I bought the portable heart sticker from
internet, Tiger wanted to check his data report for his heart rate at this App,
so he went to see the doctor whom is one of his friends, unfortunately the
doctor has been sick in hospital for some days, just Tiger visited him in the
ward.

Greeting and chatting with the friend, He almost forgot
the main purpose for coming, Tiger found two goods in the sick room he has
never seen before. One is the glasses which is very weird with a hat, other one
is the mini overhead projector. He was told by the doctor there are almost 80 %
people have suffering the neck and the waist disease for our ages, this two
things can help you watching TV on the bed instead of sitting somewhere was easy
for the your body.

He showed me the photos he was taken for those and
wanted me to buy for him immediately. It was hard to see clear what’s it? What’s
the brand? You know the man is much different with woman, he was not good at describe
what he wanted only with unclear photo, I am not quite sure what is the new goods
in market even I just heard, I had to find the needle from the sea patiently
which is more popular right now.

The glasses is easy for me to find out according to my
imagination, and it is not very expensive, done for one. But there are many
kinds of brands for the projector, Gimi is the one can link with Mi Box system,
Shen Hua looks very elegant with the shelf, the price is little expensive than
Gimi, the function is more flexible, I learned it from supplier step by step to
fully understand what the new thing is, how to link with Ipad, cell phone and
computer.

Yesterday it was delivered and we cannot wait to open
the pack, Tiger was very smart to install it smoothly under my direction. Which
is very portable, Automation focusing, Clear image, Gaming and Videos are amazing,
it is really change my mind there is a new time coming, there must be some old
digital stuffs will be replaced, so we have to learn the new things and follow
the step forward, otherwise we will be lost by this young generation.
