In Nepal, a girl can marry thrice and have
several husbands simultaneously. The custom
results from the country's backward economy and the shortage of its land resources. If
each of the lads of a family took a wife of his own, it would be a large
expense. But if they shared the same wife, this would greatly reduce the
expenditure. Of course, a girl must be married to the brothers of the same
family. And this can avoid the antagonism among the husbands. However, the girl
might feel a little humiliated. Therefore, this polyandry is disrespectful to
the female for her subordinate status.Â
