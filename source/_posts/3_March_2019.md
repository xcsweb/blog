I'm glad mother has got better and can leave her bed
and move about now. But her legs are very weak which results in her unsteady
walking even with the support of her cane. I often warn her not to go outdoors
in case she may moisten her trousers when urinating in the yard. She turned a
deaf ear to my warning not only getting out but sorting something out from the
clutter behind me. In such circumstances, I would immediately bark her back to the
room. She doesn’t know she shouldn’t do anything now. If the status quo could
be maintained, we would be extremely satisfied.
