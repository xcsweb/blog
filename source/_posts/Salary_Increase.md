Tomorrow is the last working day before we start on
the vacation mode, so during the past days, we are busying with all kinds of
summary and set up detailed target for the New Year. As normal, we should
finish the evaluation by myself and our boss, I don’t think the pay rise based
on the performance of last year, mostly, it is a formalism in my mind. I have
the experience that I did good performance the year before last, but, actually
a raise proportion is much lower than average, my boss send me off with words that
 the salary you get already achieve the
top ceiling in your position. So he can do nothing. You know, at that moment, I
really want to punch him directly, but, I can’t because I have a family to
support, so I have to endure the grievance. During the past year, I interviewed
several companies, but none of them paid more than this company so that I stayed
here one more year. I decided if my boss still didn’t provide me with ideal
percentage for a raise, I will directly argue with big boss in company,
because, I believe that the performance I did last year is higher than average
level at least. The salary increase will be announced after the Spring Festival
and need to sign up on paper. Currently, I don’t know whether I can get what I am
expected, at least it couldn’t less than average level. Let’s wait and see…
