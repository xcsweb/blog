Where is the sun? The sun is over there in the universe. Now it is covered by clouds and I can not see it for the time being. For months, the sun has not come out frequently. On the contrary, it rains a lot. Tomorrow is said to be rainy again. It has no sign the rain will stop soon.The abnormality of the weather tells us of the truth that we have to follow the god. At least right now, we still have to face the reality that we are not totally able to to make everything on our own. Since we are part of the earth and the universe. The extreme climate influences us a lot, not only on the aspects of our lives but also the productivity in industries, such as farming, fishing and so forth.The fact is the sun is always there. The change of climate can be fatal or helpful.
