     I came back from Tailand the day before yesterday.Not until now is my head completely clear. I will share something that I have seen and thought with you .       Tailand is a smiling countrry. Yes and no. The local residents are frindly and willing to help others.It was very unforgettable that many elephants around us and they are  free from restraint .We fed them different kinds of fruits.Their long noses were soflexible  that they can get the fruits qucikly and accurately,even the fruits were in the small boxes. The baby elephant was very very cute.It was only nine-month old.I love her.
