Different
people have different views on opportunity. It is held that there are few
opportunities. But it is also held that there are opportunities everywhere.
  Those who hold the first opinion think that there are too many
people and there is always an intense competition for limited opportunities. In
contrast, those who hold the second view think that if one is not prepared, he
can hardly have any opportunities: however, if one is prepared, he can have a
lot of opportunities.
  As to me, I agree with the latter. Admittedly, there is really an
intense competition for limited opportunities, but it is not to say the one
can't create opportunities himself. In most cases opportunities are created by
people themselves. For example, many people lost their jobs in recent years.
Some people wait for opportunities in vain. However, others create
opportunities themselves and get self-employed. Eventually they become employers
themselves.
  Therefore, to some extent, one can take his destiny into his own
hands.
