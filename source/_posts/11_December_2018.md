Mother suffers from lumbago again as a result of overworking. Years ago she had been confined to bed for the same reason. At that time her waist seemed to have broken. She just lay on the kang and couldn’t sit up. I had to stay at home taking care of her in the final days of the school term. The medicine brother offered healed her gradually. After her recovery, I had warned her against overwork. But she turned a deaf ear to my entreaties. She had forgotten her agony when breaking down. Then she occupied herself day in day out and now collapsed. She struggled up from lying with a painful face.
