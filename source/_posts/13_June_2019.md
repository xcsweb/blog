The emperor and
his officials are entertaining themselves there by listening to the music which
reverberates loudly through the hills. The hot spring bath is only conferred upon
those wearing official headgear. And no civilian attends the banquet dressed in
a short close-fitting jacket of
coarse cloth. 

君臣留歡娱，樂動殷樛嶱。

賜浴皆長纓，與宴非短褐。

 The silk
distributed in the court is woven by the poor women and exacted as a tribute
from their whipped husbands.

彤庭所分帛，本自寒女出。

鞭挞其夫家，聚斂貢城闕。
