As the saying goes, man struggles upwards
and water flows downwards. Nowadays more and more young and middle‐aged villagers rush to the
large cities seeking employment and wealth and leaving their old and young
behind at their rural homes. Some of these migrating workers are so successful
that they have become permanent city‐dwellers with their own apartments and cars. The longer they live
there, the clearer they see what a high price they pay for the settlement. Because
their old can’t tear themselves away from their villages, elders of empty nests
have grown. They lack necessary care. The new town dwellers find themselves second‐class citizens and their kids
rejected by one school after another except for paying more tuition fees than
the old inhabitants.
