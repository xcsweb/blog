Spring returns again to our north just a
month after the Lantern Festival with strong warm winds. The soil at the
backyard has been so soft recently that it caves in when stepped upon. The left
cabbages stored for winter use have been rotting from the exterior. Some fashionable
young people have been dressed lightly, a little early for the weather. This morning
I happened to find some newly sprouted weeds between the bricks paved on the
terrace before the house. Passing by the stream on my way to school, I saw the
badly polluted dark green water flowing quickly well below the narrow protruding
ice plates attached to the banks.Â
