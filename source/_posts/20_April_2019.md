According to the People's
Daily, since the beginning the home stretch before the college entrance
examination, the telephone service has been suspended at the students'
dormitory of Hengshui No. 2 Middle School in Hebei; the TV hasn’t been turned
on at the dining hall; there have been stacks of reviewing materials inside and
outside the classrooms.

人民日报报道：自从进入高考冲刺阶段，河北衡水二中学生宿舍的电话已被切断，餐厅电视也不再打开，教室内外堆满复习资料。In order to save time, several
eating companions have agreed to buy meals in turn, sharing the food in a large
basin at each meal. They hope to go to college at the same city. 

为了多挤出时间，几名“饭友”约定轮流买饭，每天在一个大饭盆吃饭，他们希望能到同一个城市读大学。
