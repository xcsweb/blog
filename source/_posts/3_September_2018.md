The 73rd anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. Don’t mistake Chinese for victors. It was Americans rather than Chinese who defeated Japanese. The Japanese were cowed into total submission by the two atomic bombs of mass destruction dropped in their land. So we should owe the highest gratitude to Americans. The Japanese fear Americans but despise Chinese. It was said the Japanese troops were reluctant to surrender to Chinese because they thought they hadn’t been defeated yet when they still numbered one million. Without Americans' help, no one knows how long our fighting was to last.
