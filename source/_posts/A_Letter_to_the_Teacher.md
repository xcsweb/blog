Dear Teacher Jhoan：I know you are a good handling at free talk lessons, so I made a decision to practice my oral communication with you. I will book three free talk lessons each week. Each free talk lesson follows my booked lessons. I want to ask my teacher to correct my mistakes and I will practice again and again. Please help me modify the paragraph above to make it better and more polite to my teacher. By the way, let me introduce myself. I am a boring person. In fact, I hardly have any hobbies. My favorite thing is to sit in front of the computer reading and writing some articles online. Several computers have been broken for doing this. Sometimes I also like to drive out by myself to enjoy the beautiful scenery.Thank you very much.Sincerely yoursJeffreyCorrected by Teacher Jhoan
