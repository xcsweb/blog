I couldn't tell why I passed the recognition letter to the human resource
manager; it happened.

 

In China, when I worked in a state-run company, it took me ten
years to decide whether I should quit a job or not. In the end, I made it.

 

So far I have never regretted. When a door closed, a new chapter
starts, that’s how I am here in Australia.

 

This time, it only takes a couple of days for me to tell the
human resource, “Sorry, I will finish work with the
company, hopefully at the end of next week.”

 

"Any reasons?”

 

"I am gonna start my coaching business.”

 

In fact, I have spent 3 years to explore myself by doing reading
and writing blogs.

 

I wanted to be a life coach, but I have never ever taken the
action.

 

It is until recently; I enrolled coaching course at TCI, I
coached myself by using the models and strategies I’ve
learnt; meanwhile, there are business mentors and wow team support me when I
need.

 

Don’t get me wrong; I’ve
been advised to keep the position until I get paid from the clients, then I
leave the day job.

 

But I feel sooo overwhelmed, and I have pro bono clients in a
queue, I can only take three clients per week, each for six weeks.

 

I have limited time to read books and materials, do the
assignment, register a company, start a business and develop marketing.

 

On the other hand, I am not sure what I am doing for a day job.
I don’t think my job is getting easier, it’s being more difficult to achieve the same result.

 

I no longer have a sense of job satisfaction.

 

Sometimes I spend 1 hour to fix a problem, yet there’s no record to show in the system, it seems like I am doing
nothing for one hour.

 

Because someone focuses on the numbers than the quality and the
responsibility for what I am taking.

 

I am not happy with myself at all.

 

I can be no longer tolerant for doing what is only for
money-making, and I want more which can bring my values to the others, I focus
on self-development.

 

I believe success is the one who dares to step out of the
comfort zone and accept challenges.

 

The company is a fast-growing. The boss has a lot of
passion for developing the company, I enjoy activities and the colleagues are
friendly; I can have a secure life until I get retired.

 

 

To be honest, I feel a bit sad for leaving, yet if I don’t spend time and put effort into doing what I am passionate
about, then I can never make a change of my life.

 

I know, without earning money, I might can’t
afford to buy a luxury bag, a pair of designer shoes and
fashionable clothes, though, with savings, I can pay for the necessities.

 

Think positive; now every minute I am doing what is related to
me, which makes me happy.

 

I value happiness more important than a luxury bag or a pair of
Italy-made leather shoes that makes me look good in front of the others.

 

I want to feel good from my inner heart.

 

There’s no reason if I spend most of the
time doing things on my dream list what is meaningful, it helps me to get
closer to the goal, the result will be worse than I am doing a job
only for money-making.

 

I focus on personal growth than the money itself.

 

With a beautiful picture on my mind, that one day I can get paid
from the clients because I help them to make a life change.

 

My life is driven by the purpose that I help people to achieve
their dream than only care about how much money I am making and how comfortable
the life I am having.

 

I believe I can run a successful business if I bring values to
others. Therefore, I take action to make a change of myself before I change the
life of the others.

 

That’s the way I quit the job.

 

I am not going to be a couch potato, staying at home doing
nothing. Actually, I am now taking more Pro Bono clients, having coaching
courses, workshops, reading, writing blogs and attending fitness classes.

 

I will register my own coaching business and focus on marketing.

 

There are enough things to keep me busy.

 

Currently, I am offering six free sessions for 10 ProBono
clients; they are almost booked out.

 

If you need a life change, you feel stagnant; you are eager to
succeed, you want to change your career path.

 

For Chinese people, you want to overcome fear and uncertainty
of study overseas; you want to speak English with self-confidence.
