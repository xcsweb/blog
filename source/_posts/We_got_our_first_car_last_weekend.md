      We got our first car last weekend. I drove it back from the 4S store and rent a parking space in our community.  I even don't exited for the new car because I don't confirm the necessary of a car till now. But I don't want to wast time to hesitate if we should have a car, which car is more suitable for us and will it bring us more trouble than convenience. After all, we need a tool to bring my family out and most family have a car, most people won't buy a car if there is less advantage than disadvantage.       I drove 30 KM with my wife and son. It was easy to drive a automatic car although I haven't drive a car by myself after I got driver license. It's more comfortable, safety and boring than drive a motocycle. The next is taught my wife driving and plan our spring trip. I must bring us some freely trip in the future.
