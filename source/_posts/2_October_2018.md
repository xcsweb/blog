Nearly up to noon son came over to our bungalow. Last night he stayed up very late as usual at least after midnight. I saw his eyes still heavy with sleep. Mother acted as the directions of the computer for many times before success when son recorded her movement for sending the video to the designated website.
Watched the rebroadcast of the high-standard theatrical performance of the evening party in congratulation of the Mid-autumn Festival on the Chinese International channel. Almost every song's captions were bilingual in Chinese and English. I sat close to the TV set for reading the English translation.
