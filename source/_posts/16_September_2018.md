It is worrisome and dangerous to live on the southeast coast of our country for the catastrophes caused by the landing typhoons. 
The Family Reunion Festival is only a week away. The dates in my native land will be ripe by then and got in. I still remember how I sealed up the liquor-saturated dates within two porcelain vases with mud stopping their mouths completely. After about a fortnight, the vases were opened and the former half red hard dates had been wholly red and soft with a fine bouquet. Since leaving my homeland, I have never returned for nearly four decades. Â
