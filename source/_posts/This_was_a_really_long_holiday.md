My departure day was Dec 27 and I was back to Beijing
at the mid night Jan 10, it was a really a long period and a wonderful holiday
I had, the year 2019 is new to me till today, everything in my mind still in
year 2018 including saving my name of file by yearly.

Busy for two months since Sept to end of Nov 2018 for
new house property, during this time, I cannot go anywhere just in case I have
to appear personally in the governments or in the public if necessary, due to
it was under my name. After everything was done, finally I could have the long
breath and I really need to some relaxes. And there was other reason Tiger was
invited by one of his uncles to attend the birthday party at the end of year to
Zhan Jiang city in Guang Dong province, why not we took the leave without delay
for the travelling. We would like to visit the bridge between HK and Macao, before
we left, quickly asking for the passport for it. 

We were told that at the end of the year, there was the
custom in Zhan Jiang to wish a good future. The day was inviting friends and
relatives coming to the home for the celebration, setting off firecrackers and
having the big meal. If the people coming from the long way they will be appreciated
and happy together.

Everything almost plan good for this trip, I knew that
my childhood friends would like going to Hai Nan province during this time. Why
not I can join them it is not difficult, just do it. I will fly to my friend
after New Year, Luckily I did not book the return ticket yet. At the meanwhile
Tiger had the plan with his uncle to Thailand for long time ago, without me
accompany is easy and more relaxing.Â
