Ode to the Soldiers Guarding the North-western Frontier 
The snow-crowned mountain darkens under the clouded sky in Qinghai.
In the distance Jade Gate Pass can be seen from the solitary castle.
The suits of armour of the garrison troops have been worn out through many battles in the desert.
The military will never withdraw from the fort before destroying the enemy.   
* The predicted rain came down at last after supper following the roaring thunder which is rare at this season. Tomorrow is the first day of Frost's Descent, the beginning of the 18th solar term. As the old saying goes, the Frost's Descent marks a great change of weather.
