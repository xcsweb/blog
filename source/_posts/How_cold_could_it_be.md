It has been colder since yesterday and it keeps raining. Everyone has overcoat to welcome this winter. Walking on the streets, the chilly wind sharply blows against me. The lobby of company does brighten and strengthen the atmosphere due to the Christmas decoration. It is warm particularly at the time entering into the room and seeing those cute gadgets, such as small houses, Santa and trees, all looks so sweet by the colorful lighting. This does help build the harmony.Everything is fine except for the snow. Compared to the northern areas, here it seldom snows in winter. But it does make you uncomfortable living in this season because of its cold which lets you tremble at anywhere you stay. There is no heat and you hardly succeed drying clothes especially in wet weather. The weather forecast says it is likely to snow tomorrow. According to the lunar calendar, tomorrow is the Great Snow. What a coincidence. Whether it is true or not, it does sign the coming of a real winter.Anyway we still survive from all seasons.
