I lent her almost all my liquid deposit with most of mother's. For conscience' sake, how could I be deaf to her entreaty and let her go empty-handed? Mother had always tried by all means to stop my lending any money. When she knew I had acted against her will, she got very angry. Then I explained patiently to her why I had done so. We owed her both cash and favors. So she was a debt-collector rather than a money borrower. I had declared to her she needn’t return the money any more. Now I'm quits with her, ie we don’t owe each other any money.
