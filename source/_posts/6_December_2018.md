Tomorrow will be the first day of Greater Snow, the 21st solar term. The temperature dropped sharply today and was forecast to fall to -21 ℃.It reflected one of the weather features of this period of winter. On my return home from school, I moved the cabbages into the house at once.
Q6: It is usually easy for you teachers to conduct a class, isn’t it? 
A: At a well disciplined class, we seem to deliver a lecture for two periods a day on average, i.e. one hour and a half of speech. At a badly disciplined class, we seem to have a row with somebody, quarreling one hour and a half a day. Would you have a try?  
Q7: You teachers are highly paid, aren’t you? 
A: We all see teachers attend the civil service examination for becoming government employees. Have you ever seen any public servant enter for an examination to be a teacher?
