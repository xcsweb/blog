Green grass grows on the river banks and lush
willows stand at the garden. 

青青河畔草，鬱鬱園中柳。
A well-developed and fair-complexioned
lady leans on the windowsill upstairs and gazes into the distance.

盈盈樓上女，皎皎當窗牖。
She has beautifully dressed up with her
delicate white fingers stretching out.

娥娥紅粉妝，纖纖出素手。
Once a singer, now she marries a vagrant.

昔为倡家女，今為蕩子婦。
The wanderer has not returned yet. It's intolerable
for her to sleep alone. 

蕩子行不歸，空牀難獨守。
