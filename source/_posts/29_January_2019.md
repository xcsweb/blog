An ascent of
the west gate tower of Yueyang City

登岳陽樓

by Du Fu

作者：杜甫I have ever heard of the mighty Dongting
Lake, and now I can climb up the city gate tower beside it. 

昔聞洞庭水，今上岳陽樓。
The waters divide the eastern Wu State from
the southern Chu State. The heaven and the earth seem rippling and floating on
the surface day and night.

吴楚東南坼，乾坤日夜浮。
