Last midnight, I met a sudden heavy rainfall as I almost finished the jogging. I just ran in the rain slowly for the last twenty minutes. I was wet by the sweat and then again by the rain. It is hardly to tell which is which, because the smell of both sweat and rain made it impossible to distinguish. It stopped at the time I did the last step of the jog. It did not last long, the blue sky was clear in the moonlight. Though I was fully soaked, the experience of rain was great. It was at twelve o'clock in the night as I was back. Quite and cool, I liked that time. The beginning of autumn is to come on 8, August. According to the lunar calendar, it is about to enter into the season of autumn. Precisely, hot days won't occupy too long. It is unthinkable to live without an air-condition. You just sweat by doing nothing while an air condition rescues your life. It was wise to go out in the night. By the way, there are few guys and vehicles. That is my way. Surely, some others choose doing it in the morning. Anytime is all right as long as you feel fine.
