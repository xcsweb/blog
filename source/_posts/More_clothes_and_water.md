It is cold outside and leaves of deciduous trees have almost fallen off. Now it starts out the theme of winter. I prepare well for this since I have enough clothes and water. In order to keep warm and healthy, it is strongly recommended that we really have to take care ourselves.After days of rainning, it turns to be sunny today. I haven't seen cleary the sunshine for weeks. What a long time. After baptism from the sunshine, the twillight came soon. The day is so short which will last to the Winter Solstice.The side effect of winter is it is extremedously hard for most of us to get up on time in the morning on weekdays. I see many guys catching buses or rushing to subway stations. I was in that situation too at the first beginning. The warm quilt is always like a magnetic and invisible hand which powerfully holds you back to get up. Luckily I am back to be normal after several days' adjustment, as always, I get up without hesitation.
