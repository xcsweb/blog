The stream on my way has frozen over.
It felt warmer today than the past few days. My underwear close to back and bottoms had been soaked through with sweat when I cycled to school. The interior of my headgear and gloves also got wet.
Recently I found a tractor has been working in the corn fields beside the road. A machine pulled behind collected the remains of corn stalks and squeezed them into large cylinders just like stone rollers on the threshing ground. It reminded me of the dung beetle and the round balls it rolls.  
Mother felt better after a plaster applied to the bottom of her back.
I had a bad toothache now and then today and yesterday. The pain derived from the lower grinding teeth on the left. 
Gave only one class today; the other four conducted by class advisers concerned. 
In this evening's Get Braver with Fighting, winner of the silver microphone was a policeman surnamed X for his brave fighting against cancer rather than performance.
