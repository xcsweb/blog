March is a good month of the year, Spring will be
coming soon, the sunrise is coming early in the morning than cold winter, all
plants and trees are willing to say hello to every one after it has long
sleeping soundly, My life seems going to normal after busy February, even Tiger
still needs to have a good rest in the bed for his waist, but at least he can
take the walk slowly.

Since we made the decision to cure the conservative
treatment for his waist, after we went to health centre hospital for almost two
weeks, we have been told there was an essential oil can be warm when sprinkling
to your body, I followed the instruction for him every two times a day. There
is a kind of electric Wax bag has the same principle to be hot to stick on your
body, I bought it from the Tao Bao, as long as these are no harmful I am
willing to try for him. Hopefully he can recovery to be original.

I haven’t made the meeting with my dear friends for
quite long time, although I was invited by many times including shopping to Bai
Rong, where is one of my favourite shopping mall, we had the plan to buy the
same uniform for the next outing, a pity it was only missing me at amount of
them. There was one appointment of my friends to Xie Island even the weather was
not so good at the day, but I concerned them all the time and I did kindly
refused, because of I was busy with Tiger, I did not want him feeling lonely at
home when he needs my helps.

Now life is getting to the normal almost, Tiger wants
to Study English at EF like I did in the past, I am so happy to encourage him
to learn English no matter where he choose, I can say the life is beautiful
with the sunshine boy and girl.
