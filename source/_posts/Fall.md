As the scent of osmanthus flowers is everywhere in these days, it signs the moment of fragrance arrives. These days, considered as the ideal weather, neither cold nor hot, is the nice time to enjoy the mercy of god. On the way to the office, I saw many guys having coats. Anyway, it is a little bit cool in the morning and evening, and warmer in the day. Some fallen leaves gradually scatter on the ground. The red and yellow leaves decorate streets and later are collected by garbage workers. According to the weather forecast, it has the temperature reduced. Obviously, it is cooler than what it was days before. From the noon it started to drizzle. Then more leaves will sporadically land down and demonstrate the beautiful scenery. The season just begins.
