Cheating is rather commonplace, which finds
its way in all aspects of life. The application of new and high technologies to
cheating makes people hard guard against it. Almost everyone has ever been
deceived. We should earn our living by honest labor rather than deceit. The swindlers
can only succeed for some time but not forever. Sooner or later these criminals
will be caught red-handed and punished somehow. At first the tricksters seem
intelligent and dominate the situation. Their endless avarice will betray them
one day when they behave as foolishly as victims of their hoaxing. It's unreasonable to take
revenge on the cheater at the cost of life.
