A good day. It was freezing cold early in the morning. I could see ice formed overnight outside and the muddy dirt path had hardened temporarily. But soon after the sunrise the fragile frozen surface of the road melted into a muddy state again. Nevertheless, most parts of the road have turned dry. Both in the flat and our office, I enjoyed the comfortable warmth. On the inner side of the windowpanes at the balconies could be seen tiny drops of water like beads of perspiration every morning after I got up. In fact I feel a little hot indoors sometimes even when dressed in next-to-skin wear at home. The heating supply should be reduced a little in such mild weather to avoid unnecessary waste.
