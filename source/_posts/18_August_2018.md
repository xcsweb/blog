Fell ill. Felt a little ill in the stomach yesterday when returning home. I think it might have been for my eating the muskmelon and drinking some cold boiled water. Nevertheless, I ladled a bowl of the liquid out of the cold porridge and drank it with some walnut seeds. Back in the flat I began to have diarrhea without desire to eat the half-rotten fruits any more. This morning at breakfast I had a poor appetite. Soon my stomach ached intolerably and accompanied by loose bowels and vomiting. I phoned brother asking him to buy some medicine. He was fully being occupied with selling sacrificial paper but he reluctantly consented to my request.
