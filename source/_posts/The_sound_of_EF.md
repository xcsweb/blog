There will have English speech of EF in national competition,
right now starting for primary election in each training centres of Beijing. I
am the English lover. I really envy somebody who can speak good English and so
confident to show themselves in the public when they are speaking. 

Yesterday was Mother’s day and weekend as well, I
believe most of the mothers and her families had been gone out for the celebration.
I was invited by Tiger to attend this speech because he knew I will like it, even
there is a little rainy outside, we were going to there by bike that would be
much romance than any other families in the restaurant.

The class room was not so big, there were only 10
participants and three judges. We were always the early bird, after confirm we were
only for listening and still welcome to the class by the trainer. The class
will be started at 2.30am while we had the chat with one of judge who was Asian
people. All participants would have competition order by lucky draw like
playing game. The first one was a girl with short skirt and jacket. She was a
little nervous to introduce herself and after five minutes, She had gone into
her role to read the poem with lovely back ground music, even she played it by
her cell phone, I cannot read her clearly what she main meaning but from her
emotional, I can see she has good pronunciation and intonation. The second one
was a boy who was sitting in front of stage to read an English story with
music, so attractive me was he was never shy to act what he did, maybe this is
the generation after 90s. One of judge was a foreign face who was the manager
of this training centre. His comments to each students were honest and in
detail, some words are encouragement but some words to tell what should be
improved during the speech, like eye contact to audiences and smiling of the
speakers are most important factors, you know some of students were shy to speak,
so their voice was not louder enough and hardly to control the speed of
speaking.

One girl was so impressive to me, she was so confident
on the stage, she did not read, all tell the story from her mind, she has prepared
the show for four days that would be much better than reading the text. One
short boy who was the couch, his work in the fitness was only for his tuition
fee, he was from He Bei province that’s why he was apologist to everyone for being
late be his starting. 

If I were the one to be participant, I believe I can
do it and maybe I can do it well. This is a really good class I like the
atmosphere there, I learned a lot. Everybody is modest, kindly and friendly to
others no matter you are the member or not, Here are the international family, I
believe everyone here are English lover, why they are here together.
