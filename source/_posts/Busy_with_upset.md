    The bad mood is always around me and it even impacts my daily life. Sometimes, I am wondering whether I can't manger my own time so that I feel busy with upset, or can I keep a better status as before. No doubt, recently the workload makes me coking so that I couldn't help shouting at somebody. This change I already knew, but, I would like to say it really hard to make those change in a short time. Even though I already express my opinion and current situation to my supervisor even my supervisor's boss. But, the final decision is to keep the current status before new employees were recruited. I feel disappointed but can do nothing, because, I don't make a decision leaving here immediately, due to I have a family to support, before I get a new job I can't do anything that make my repentant later. When I calm down, I told me everything will be fine after each tough time. But, this time, I felt hard to control myself not only the outsider environment changed but the internal situation is changed quickly. It is obvious that I feel most of us can't stand this working style any more. But, I know it isn't reached the breaking point. I believe if the current situation will continue to a long time, it will quickly beak out full-scale explosion. I don't want to see the day happens, I expect the current situation could become better gradually. Can I see what I expected? I have no idea.
