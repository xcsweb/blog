As soon as I step
in the front gate, I hear wailing with grief because my youngest son has died
of starvation. 

入門聞號啕，幼子飢已卒。How can I suppress
my sorrow any more when my neighbors are also sobbing with sadness?

吾寧舍一哀，里巷亦嗚咽。As a father, I feel
deeply ashamed at being unable to raise my children.

所愧為人父，無食致夭折。I wonder that the poor families
can hardly feed themselves in spite of the fair harvest this autumn. 豈知秋禾登，貧窭有倉卒。
