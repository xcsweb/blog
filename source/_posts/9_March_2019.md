It's more important to learn to behave than to
study. But the world thinks contrarily. So it's enough for a child to be
excellent in his or her study. Thatâ€™s why nowadays most youngsters know nothing
except for attaining high marks. They are praised and rewarded for their achievements
in study. They fail to realize the responsibilities they should take in other
aspects. They lack decent behavior both at home and outside. They feel no
gratitude to their parents and people who have helped them. They take it for
granted that their parents serve them as slaves attending their masters. They're very selfish regardless
of others' feelings.
