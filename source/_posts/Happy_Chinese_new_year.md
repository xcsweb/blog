Chinese New Year eve is the most important day in a
year, the day is the family get together, no matter where you are, everybody
wants to go back home and sitting in front of parents and relatives have an
evening dinner. That’s why a lot people just for the day, working overtime
before the day, trying to finish the all the work. Many stores have to be
closed by nonlocal bosses and back home as early as they can. Overseas Chinese
booked the return tickets at the half year ago. All just for catching the day
of Chinese Eve.

Luckily I am local here, and most of my relatives are
all in my city, so I don’t need to think about ticketing booking before the
holiday. This year it was my turn to take care my father in low. Because of the
last year his brother was in charge. I knew A Yi she must be go home during the
holiday, so I had to find somebody instead, otherwise I cannot image How can I take
care the old man 24 hours personally, I am lack of patient even my mom. 

Anyway new A YI I have found the one by accident. She
is from Dong Bei province, she is a easy going person, She is working in Beijing
to the baby sister more than one year, she is just absent at the holiday, she
is willing come to my home, just as it happened, This new AYI is a really qualify
assistant and good at cooking. On the working day she is easy motion, general
good character, what I told her, she can remember my point clearly.

At the day of eve, as traditional Chinese way the
family has to go to man’s house, maybe the man is the king of family. So after
I married I have no chance go to my home at the eve. This year luckily after
big lunch with tiger’s family, we were allowed go back our own home for the
golden evening. A Yi gave us a lot helps for prepare the eve dinner. This year
the same day of the beginning of spring, spring pancake has to have at the day,
so she made it instead of dumpling, There were BBQ big prawn, pork knuckle,
lotus cake and fried fish, what I liked was Rio which is kind of drink, the advertisement
by pop star Zhou Dong Yu recently

So this year eve evening I was so happy with my family
at my own home, hopefully every year I can have the same year eve.
