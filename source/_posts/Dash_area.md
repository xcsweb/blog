I believe everybody has the dash area in their life.
Yesterday I watched TV, there was a famous guest of honour Huang Lan to mention
about her experience of the dash area. When she was at the school time. Her mother
would like her to offering the wine on the dinner party to others, she was so
shamed to speak in public, but she had to do this, otherwise her mother was unhappy
for her performance. Until she became adult, she still hesitated and be afraid
of cheer or speak on the table. Obviously the parents did not lead the right
way for the child on the social relationship.

Let me sharing my sentimental experience here. When I
was a little girl, I lived in a big family member courtyard since I was born,
meaning was the working space, staff canteen, dormitory and school were all in
our courtyard together, we had our own theatre, swimming pool, library and clinic.
As I know there were about five hundreds families and more than a thousand employees.
So this was a really big company, my childhood, the neighbour or my parent’s
colleague we all knew each other well. What’s happened for whose family. My mom
was a self respect proud, so she always forced me greeting first voluntarily to
her colleagues or neighbours when we were meeting each other on the street,
which I really did not like it and hard to accept kind of polite ways, that’s
why I had never taken the walk with my mom afterward. Till my wedding marriage
day, the car picked me to leave our courtyard, I said that I left here finally,
the meaning of my life will not be greeting each other again, I really did not want
to show my respect artificially.

Now I am still thinking I get the clear and appreciate
action what in life.
