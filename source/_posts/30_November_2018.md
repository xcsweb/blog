Yesterday an excavator was put to use removing the earth of the higher ground in the skating rink. 
The axle of the wheelbarrow needs to be changed for it has got out of order. 
This afternoon many of my colleagues were busy preparing to undergo an inspection from above next Monday. A lot of written materials must be finished for cheating the inspectors. Such image projects have come into being for so long and involved a sheer waste of time and vigor. These frequent inspections are an intolerable burden to our principals and some teachers. The higher our pay, the heavier our work.
