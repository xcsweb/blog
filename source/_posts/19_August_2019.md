I felt uneasy about the patch of wetness
close to the eaves at southwest corner. I ascended a height to have a look on
the roof just above and discovered a tile had been slipping out of place.

檐底洇濕惶戚戚，登高擧目瓦脱離。Thanks to the temporarily fine day, I could
climb up the ladder onto the roof and crawl forward to solve the problem in
time. 

倚梯伏頂急脩葺，青天白日來相濟。
