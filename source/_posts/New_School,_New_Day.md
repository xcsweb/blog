 What a long and hectic week it was! Three
days in hospital, two days in school for parents’ assembly, and then a busy weekend
preparing for the new school opening, I’m glad finally now, I have some moments
to relax.

 

My son’s life in Middle school started from
a 10-days military training—it is said to be the toughest one among all the others,
so he came back with a pretty tanned, thinner version. There were doubts among
the parents, but personally I thought it was not bad to prepare those a little
spoiled kids to have a taste of the real hardship, because the middle school
life won’t be easy and they really need to be mentally, physically ready for
the coming battle. 

 

The study load in Middle school has
increased four times even five times than primary school but with only half of
that time, and less than 50% of them could go to the high school, so what else
could we expect? 

 

The food was terrible, the living condition
was awful and the training was hard. But when I heard him babbling about the
friends he’d made, the money he’d saved, and how they missed home, how they sneaked
out at 5:00 am to pack up, I thought it was worth it. 

 

The school also prepared two days’ parents
assembly for us to know better about its teaching staffs, its education concept
and mostly important, to prepare us as the parents for the coming three years. Some
doubts start to wear off. 

 

It’s still a new school and I couldn’t
shake off the nagging thought that the reason why we chose it over a private
school is because of my disease. I can’t deny the fact that this choice is a
relief financially. 

 

Sometimes I kept asking myself if it is the
right decision. Now I think I should place more faith in this school, in our
decision, and in us.
