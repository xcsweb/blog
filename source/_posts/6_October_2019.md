I still remember, long long ago, in my poor
native village in central Hebei, mother would paste sheets of some special  paper
over our lattice window by the end of autumn.

遥想冀中窮巷，秋盡毛帋糊窻。In the middle of the lower part of the
window was inlaid with a piece of glass for looking out. Then the whole room felt
warm and bright. 

下嵌玻璃瞭望，滿室温馨清光。
