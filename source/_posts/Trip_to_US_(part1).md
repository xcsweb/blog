July of this year, One of good friends of Tiger
Janie had the plan to US for traveling, mainly visiting for nature view
including Yellow park and Grand Canyon. Tiger and I has been to America in year
2012 with his sister, even we went to many cities from east of US to the
western part, that time we were focus on human landscape and places of
historical figures and cultures, invite us to go with them together in October.
Yellow park is one of our favorite place all the time, and we were told
everything the friend has made the detail schedule including renting the car,
the air ticket and hotel or motel, whatever everything is on the paper. We were
happy accept the invitation, Hurry up for visa first, due to three months left only.

We are the luck birds, everything is smoothly
for visa and EVUS, after confirmed it we were going to booking the ticket. The ticket
was from Oct 3rd to Oct 23th, How come the price for round trip from
BJ to Los Angeles is only 3000 rmb, and it was the golden holiday must be
expensive than others, it is not Dollar for sure, and it is unbelievable! My dear
Dannie he was the greatest master of network.

Unfortunately, in the beginning of September
Tigerâ€™s heart attack again, he must be has the operation immediately, one week
later, the minimally surgery was done for Tiger in An Zhen hospital which is
one of good hospital in China, everything was not bad, only we were worry about
Tiger can be suffering the long trip after the heart operation, if we postpone
or cancel that we will not be wish, but if we insist on it, if something
happened, even we have checked the medical insurance how we can ask for helps
if something happened during the trip. The doctor said it should be no problems
for the trip if no some urgent cases, takes it easy. Finally I put down my
heart gradually.

Dannie gave me a folder with the detail schedules
and plans, I was lazy to read line by line, you know if somebody around you is
smart and diligent, you might easy to be a lazy man, so we just took our luggage
and the passport to follow our friends, starting our three weeks US trip.
