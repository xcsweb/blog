The question about human beings sometimes makes us a pround thinking. We may live poorly, but we never stop pursuing everything around us. That pushes us moving forward. It does not tell us what we should do. It just directs us potential access to success. Not a thing is as easy as we presume. We only know its skill in person by practical exercises. From the invention of paper-making to steam engine to computer, we just make it. Meanwhile, we have technology of going into space and discocering microparticles. In that way, we survive and thrive.
