This afternoon it started to snow. In two hours, small snow becomes heavy and everything is under its silence. Today is the first day of the New Year's Day and it is the nice present for the coming new year. According to the current situation, it will be beautiful tomorrow. Many guys probably will visit the West Lake again this evening. Some of them even get up earlier next morning at aroud 3 to 4 am to the lake. Three weeks ago it snowed heavily for the first time this year which already had brought happiness for us. We rarely meet this kind of snow in life. Such a chance won't be missed again. People will flock into scenic areas to have fun with it. This is the last one in 2018. In two days, it will be the year 2019. Another new year is already there. How time flies. The timely snowfall promises a fruitful year.
