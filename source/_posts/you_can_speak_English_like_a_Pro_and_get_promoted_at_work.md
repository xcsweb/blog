I have some Pro Bono clients who are eager to speak English like
a pro so that they can talk with international clients.

 

If they speak fluent English, that will significantly increase
the chance for them to get promoted at work, to be a team leader, a manager or
later on a CEO.

 

Everything is possible. Yes, I guarantee you can speak as good
English as you imagine.

 

Speaking English is like driving a car, the more time and effort
you put, the better result you get.

 

Someone told me, “I want to speak
excellent English.”

 

“How many hours you spent per week?” I
asked.

 

“ A few hours a week.”

 

“Come on, if you spend a few hours a day, that’s
ok.”

 

It depends on your goal.

 

If you want to travel overseas and speak simple English, you don’t need to take it seriously. Just practice whenever you feel
like.

 

However, if your goal is to speak English like a pro, you want
to be a CEO, a manager, a team leader, a coach, a public motivational speaker
or you want to work in a better company.

 

Then you must spend a few hours a day on learning English.

 

Speaking English like a pro, it is not only about speaking
itself.

 

Improving listening skill is essential.

 

In fact, listening is more critical in communication, without
understanding what the other people are trying to tell you, that would be the
end of the conversation.

 

Reading is the key element for your English to reach the
professional level, and that makes you different from most of the others who
never read English books.

 

If you want to be a leader, read English books with regards to
leadership skill;

 

If you're going to run a successful business, then read English
books about sales, marketing;

 

If you need more self-confidence, then buy books in related to
how to boost your self -confidence.Writing blogs is a very effective way.

Passing IELTS is not enough to be a professional.

 

If you only focus on IELTS, you will be stressed; it teaches the
skill how to get high marks in the exam, though it’s a
requirement for you to be an overseas student or for immigration purpose.

 

After that, there’s not much meaning for
IELTS.

 

If I ask my Aussie colleagues, I bet no one knows what IELTS is.

 

In a job market in Australia, no one ever cares about how high
marks you got in IELTS.

 

I have some Pro Bono clients; they have never studied in an
English speaking country; they try to find a way how to improve English in
China.

 

Some speak excellent English. They practice speaking with
foreigners online; they listen to the TED; some join English courses or go to
the English corner.

 

Therefore, please don’t blame you for
staying in China, you don't have an English environment, that’s
the reason you can’t speak good English.

 

I can confirm that it is not correct. You must believe you can
speak fluent English and find a way to achieve your dream.

 

There’s a Facebook post from my business
mentor, Deborah Kleinert.

 

If you have a clear goal/outcome that is important.

If you can picture it and see it.

If you are clear on the person, you wish to become, then it is a
possibility.

 

If you believe in your goal and yourself,

If you are putting in place a plan and positive habits

If you are taking consistent action towards achieving it

Then you are on your way

 

If you are tracking your progress

If you are making small incremental improvements towards your
outcome

If you are achieving small wins, making progress or moving
forwards

Then it’s only a matter of time

 

If you stick at it despite the challenges and obstacles

If you keep showing up even though you don’t
feel like it

If you are continuously learning and making improvements

Then you are on the road to mastery
