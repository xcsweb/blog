Today is the first day for the Spring Festival. And this afternoon, it started to rain again. Neither so cold nor so warm, I just feel it is fine to start my time being home. I was asked what I was planning to do during this holiday. I replied by smiles: "Read something." Besides, I still keep strolling around. I do not consider putting on weight by eating a lot. Simple life always is the best companion I am glad to be with. "How do you spend your time in the festival?", another question would be asked. I say that it is quite as usual as normal. I do not have to be hard on what it is supposed to be. It also could get there by choosing another way.Tonight is extraordinarily quiet. As if it were into sleep. Good night.
