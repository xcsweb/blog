As a fifteen-year old boy, Tom's calmness and courage in the face of adversity really deserves our praise and appreciation. When his father collapsed under the mortal blow of losing the lawsuit, he stands up bravely and determines to protect his mother and sister as a man should do in such circumstances. In view of this respect, Tom's schooling is fruitful and worthy. Although he's dull in commanding knowledge, his defying attitude towards the challenge of life is heroic and adorable. Nowadays the education of outlook on life has been largely ignored both at school and home; once the young people only trained for grasping knowledge are in unfavorable circumstances, they would be in perplexity.
