To inquire and to learn is the function of the mind.By learning IÂ  do not mean the mere cultivation of memory or the accumulation of knowledge,but the capacity to think clearly and sanely without illusion,to start from facts and not from beliefs and ideals.There is no learning if thought originates from conclusions.Merely to acquire information or knowledge is not to learn.Learning implies the love of understanding and the love of doing a thing for itself.Learning is possible only when there is no coercion of any kind.And coercion takes many forms,does it not?There is coercion through influence,through attachment or threat,through persuasive encouragement,or subtle forms of reward.Most people think that learning is encouraged through comparison,whereas the contrary is the fact.Comparison brings about frustration and merely encourages envy,which is called competition.Like other forms of persuasion,comparison precents learning and breeds fear.
