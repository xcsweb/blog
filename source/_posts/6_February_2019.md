Words of the song:

歌词：

Have
you ever heard that a girl had been to the stream that you are crossing?

走过那条小河，你可曾听说，

有一位女孩，她曾经来过；Have you known that a girl
had left a song to the reed slope that you are passing by?走过那片芦苇坡，你可曾听说，



有一位女孩，她留下一首歌。Why are the clouds weeping
quietly?

为何片片白云悄悄落泪?Why are the gentle breezes
whispering?

为何阵阵风儿轻声诉说?And why are a flock of red-crowned
cranes flying over lightly?

还有一群丹顶鹤，轻轻地轻轻地飞过。Just because the girl
never shows up again.

有一位女孩，她再也没来过Only the clouds shed tears
for her;只有片片白云为她落泪，only
breezes whisper about her;只有阵阵风儿为她诉说，in
addition there is a flock of red-crowned
cranes flying over softly. 还有一群丹顶鹤，











轻轻地轻轻地飞过。
