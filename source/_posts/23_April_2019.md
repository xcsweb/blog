A takeaway delivering guy in Shangqiu couldn’t bear to see an old street peddler waiting any longer, buying
up her unsold green vegetables.    

商丘外卖小哥买下老人所有青菜 不忍心让老人苦等

 "This old peddler sold vegetables here
almost every day and never returned home before selling them out. If she failed
to sell all her vegetables, she would wait there or ride her trike about the
street. It was a hotter day yesterday. Up to one o'clock pm, she was still
waiting there to sell the left green vegetables. ”Ms Wang recounted, “then I was videoing. Seeing
the takeout delivering lad purchasing all the left vegetables, I was so moved
to video it. ”“这个老人几乎天天在这边卖菜，每次都是卖完才回去。如果卖不完她就一直在那等，或者骑着车子在街上转。昨天天气比较热，老人还有一些青菜没有卖完，都下午一点了，她就一直在那。”王女士介绍道，“当时我刚好正在拍视频，看到外卖小哥把菜都买了，觉得很感动，就拍下来了。”
