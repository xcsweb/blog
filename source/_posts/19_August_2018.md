I almost recovered from the bad attack of diarrhea. I was still weak from the illness. I had vomited all I had eaten at breakfast yesterday, and then without any lunch and supper. I had thought to have a good rest today. But I knew brother urgently needed help now for his trade because the Festival for the Dead is approaching. If I had not been ill yesterday, I would have offered him help. So I headed for his home after taking a little porridge in the early morning. On my arrival I saw brother was loading sacrificial paper onto the van for delivery. A throng of customers came after another. I was in charge of moving the goods from the storehouses to the trading place filling the vacancy left by selling.
