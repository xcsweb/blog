Come to Thailand the most important is to see lady-boy
show and adult show for the most of tourists. But this time we did not go to
the bar or nightspot, because of we took the baby together, so we only went to
some places including Dolphin Bay and riding elephant.

After egg island tension experience, we did not stop
our steps for the next daily tour. At the following day as we planned, we went
to Banana Beach in the morning, the shape of beach is really like a banana, it
is more nature and the water is blue and clean enough, only a few people
playing the water with their lovers on the beautiful beach, one of my friend
was talking a group photo for us under the sunshine which was I like so much.

The ticket of Dolphin bay we had been booked was at 1pm,
we quickly had the local simple lunch and then took the car around 1 hour away.
The driver was a really good local guy, my daughter knew him just at the first
tour be our driver, and we learn he was a quiet people and keeping his smiling
face always, his English was not good, but we can talk each other with the body
language for helps, thatâ€™s why at the following days tours, we would like him
to be our full time driver.

Dolphin show I have seen it in somewhere before, but
Dolphin Bay in Phuket is one of biggest modern and update show in the world,
seating in the front you have to wear the rain coat, otherwise it must be a lot
water to be out, three staffs and one host organized on the stage, at the first
they invited your family take the photo with Dolphin on the stage with 400 THB,
making some good atmosphere with strong music by the host, and then four of
dolphins were dancing on the water, the staff with dolphin was so match playing
together in different posts. The baby was so concentration on the show, focus
on the action of Dolphin and trying to learn from them. In general this was
really good for children.
