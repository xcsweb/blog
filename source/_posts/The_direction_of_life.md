  The direction of lifeWe don't know when we were born, but later we were told. At the beginning, the route we lived in was happy, how to be happy and how to survive.    What is the long semester for, in order to be curious about new knowledge? Access to wisdom? Later we used for find resources of survival. This is part of the material of life. If you only need to be happy, you only need to play the game every day, but the material part is indispensable. From this we have produced something that is connected to society----work. What work is the direction of our lives.   I feel that there are two conditions in the direction of life. The first is to obtain resources for survival and protect themselves. Second, I can forget everything in it, forget the outside world, forget myself, and forget "forgot."
