One of my good friends Mr. Meng told me there was a Coffee
Show at Exhibition Centre for three days only in Beijing, Today was the last
day of the show, I followed the instruction down load App first to get the
digital ticket. As plan I met him at the entrance around 10am this morning. As
I knew he likes audio system, collection, Jade ware and coffee etc, that’s why
I like following him to go there, to learn some knowledge of coffee and support
my blog as well.

He was late because of the traffic, I was waiting there
for a half hour, just taking some photos in front of entrance, this was my
first time to see coffee show, even I bought some coffee bean and coffee powder
when I was travelling to some countries, but I did not know how to make the
coffee with the machine, how to foaming milk and tasting many kind of coffees, I
guess I cannot get to the sleep well tonight.

There was so attractive for a 3D printing on the milk,
you can select the picture as you like in the system, I asked printing a piece
of flower on the top of milk, just one second, like a stamp, a beautiful rose
was printed. As I knew before Vanilla powder is good for a coffee if it was a
little bitter for normal people, but today I realized the syrup in different favours
is good for coffee right now, it is under 100 yuan for one litter bottle, it is
not expensive I must say, it was cheaper than Jing Dong and shopping mall as well.

There were many Italian coffee beans and powder, Lavazza,
Versilia. Toschi which is a brand of syrup is popular right now. In fact I know
nothing about coffee before. Mr. Meng introduce me some friends there, some of
them are the mangers of counter and some of them are the agency of coffee. If you
want to open a coffee shop with one of brands coffee, they would provide the
machine and training for the staff, and also give you the proposal how to running
a shop, and I was told they are only renting the machine for their profits. So if
you want to invest your spare money, you should think about it.

Very a sense of fulfilment half day I had, I should
thank my friend Mr. Meng bring me to this industry, I came back with fruitful
results, not only for some of packages coffee I bought, but also I have learn a
lots of coffee and I have known some friends as well.
