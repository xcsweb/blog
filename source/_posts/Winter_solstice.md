This winter solstice is not that cold. On the contrary, it is warm enough. It started raining last night. What a winter. It rains from time to time. As it is considered to be the fake winter, the weather forecast reported it was to get cold again next week. The abnormality implies another potential snow.This night is the longest night in a year and tomorrow days are getting longer and longer which will end its longest day on the Summer Solstice every year. In less than ten days, the year 2019 is coming. How days fly without any information. Whatever, we are getting on. What can we do to prevent that? A youg heart, a posiive mind, or a well planned scheme? It depends on what we see and what we want.Winter solstice is the day of tomb sweeping for many people. Meanwhile it is also the festival geographically from palce to place that guys eat dumplings or some other food such as rice cakes.
