As following is EF English material I would like
sharing with you.

Change can be
a scary thing. Big changes – for example, having to move or having to find a
new job – can mean big stress. Your status quo is interrupted, and you are pushed
out of your comfort zone.

There are
three basic stages we go through when faced with significant change. The difference
is how long you stay at each stage. The first stage is resistance. When you
hear about a change, your first thought is that you don’t want to change. There
is uncertainty and doubt about the future.

The second
stage is going with the flow. In this stage, you go with the change, and do
what you have to do to survive. You accept the change, but you aren’t excited
about it.

The third
stage is openness. This means having an open mind about the possibilities the
change might bring. Even if it’s a change you don’t like, you start thinking of
your strategy for dealing with it. You accept the change and begin to develop
your own plan for the future. The more quickly you can reach stage three, the
more quickly you can adjust to a change.

I deeply understand the feeling for three stages of
the changes. When I worked in the company, there were many kinds of examples, I
changed a new job or transferring to a new department. I had the same feeling
to develop my own plan for my career. I have moved my house four times after
marriage, before I moved my family, I was really doubt the new place was good
or bad, but due to SAS I had to move from crowded to more roomy area. That’s
why I like copying the words here to remember expression.
