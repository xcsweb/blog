Tell you the truth, a trip without plan is the name of
our friends group in wechat, we had many kinds of the tours without plan, easy
come easy go. We only took one or two days leaves at last few years. This year
we discussed long time in the group since two month ago, finally we were going
to Mi Yun district at the suburbs in Beijing. We have learned the buildings of
village is totally copied from Wu Zhen where is very popular in China, Beijing
Wtown (古北水镇).

Two days tour as our plan, to avoid rush hour traffic,
six of us left home after 9am at Tuesday morning, for sure I am one of the
driver, in fact I don’t like driving too long time on the way, because of my
waist is hardly in one pose at the limitation space for such long time, but I
had to show my loves in front of them, no complain, hehe. We drove about 120
kilo meters away in high way, unfortunately the traffic was very smoothly, it
took about two hours to be there. We quickly checked in the farm house near the
village, the room was clean with free Wife, but the meal was not including the
room charge, the mean we had to pay the three meals additional upon your
expenses, anyway, take the thing easy. 

As we were told Beijing Wtown is good at the evening time
with many different lightings of building, and this is very famous night scene
in Beijing right now. that’s why we entered the scene around 4pm, you knew the
ticket is 150 yuan per each. The women as our ages likes to show our self in
the public, frankly speaking I dislike, but in among of them I just was following
some actions for the group pictures, they like wearing the colourful long scarf
for the picture at the sea or the top of mountain. As I know many young people
are laughing at them deeply. I never thought I am the one get laughed at. Maybe
I was thinking too much, just enjoy yourself, don’t care others feeling.

We never were missing any corners of building to take
the photo shooting for the group picture, Mrs Jing Li is our leader of the
group, she always called us please forward to other places quickly, don’t stay
here too long, otherwise, we will be missing the music fortune for the first
show at 6.30pm. it was great that the picture and carton video showing on the
top of temple building by high technique with the matching music, I remembered I
had seen the similar music show in Singapore in many years ago, right now it is
all coming with Chinese components and cultures. Other show so attractive so
much There were almost a hundred UAV（Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle）to
be Kong Ming lanterns flying to the night sky together in different shapes, it
was amazing to see the show at Mid autumn festival, the moon was super star,
everyone would like to have the great luck under the light moon.

What a wonderful night we had, we forgot the things
which we unexpected, just totally in happiness. Please see our pictures here to
share with you all.
