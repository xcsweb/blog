Every Friday I am very busy especially in the
afternoon. Normally after lunch I am starting busy to loading the things take
to Pan Shan home including foods, and then from 2pm I drive to pick Tiger up first
and go to Pan Shan directly. It is taken about one hour and a half on the high way,
after we are home, I am just doing my cleaning works for three floors and prepare
for the dinner as well. How busy I am you can see.

This Friday I did the same, I did not take care my
cell phone when I was busy with my jobs. After dinner I got the phone call
again, calling from one of my previous colleague said, have you seen your
wechat message yet? I just realized to check it up immediately, Helen she was a
financial assistant in the management corporation, Tai Yuan Kempinski GM Mr.
Alvaro Rautenberg wanted to look someone for helps. I knows this German guy who
was an F&B Director for ages, He asked Helen for helps thatâ€™s why Helen
called me very urgently.

I added the guy in wechat at once, the guy still
remembered me when I was in the company, he said he wanted someone can do
Financial closing for coming month August, due to the new employee will only on
board at September 10th , maybe only for 3-4 days working. But you know
I will go to Thailand with my family at Sept 2 for 7 days, definitely I cannot
help for this time, so I was kindly to tell my reason and refused this
invitation to him, he was a little disappointed and he said it was good for
you, Rosanna. 

In fact, only for few days I am unwilling to go to other city for busy
works, on the contrary if for the period, maybe one month or two months, for
travelling or for known some new friends, I would like to try and make some
small money, I do believe myself I can helps for financial closing after I left
the company for ages.
