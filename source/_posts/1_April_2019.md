I'm glad today that I went with the wind both to and
from school. After rising, the first thing to do was to fetch brother's trike for carrying
back the coal from school. If I had gone there after breakfast, it would have
been hard for me to move the trike out of the yard because the passageway would
have been blocked by his customers with the sacrificial paper they had chosen. It
took me less time and effort to cycle to school. What did please me most is
that I should have pedaled back with the heavy load before the strong wind for
the first time. Moreover, I perspired little. On such occasions, it's really rare not to
change the sweat-soaked underclothes for dry ones.Â
