<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;My little brother still single at the age of 33s. That isn&apos;t a big problem for a man who worked&#xA0;Shanghai,&#xA0;&#xA0;but it becoming a more and more anxious thing&#xA0;for my family members&#xA0;and relatives who still live in the country.&#xA0; My mother even can&apos;t sleep&#xA0;somtimes because the anxiety, especially in&#xA0;the last two years.&#xA0; They want to push my little brother to have a girlfriend and&#xA0;get marriged as soon as possible.</p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; On the contary,&#xA0; my little brother seemed not so hurry to get a girlfriend, although he hope that.&#xA0; He is an independent man and have a good job, and have his own mind of the standard of his Miss right.&#xA0;The problem is,&#xA0;&#xA0;he always told us that he has no feeling for the girl after meeting with several girls, and he won&apos;t to marry a common girl&#xA0;.&#xA0; And he don&apos;t tell us what kind of girl is his Miss right.&#xA0; He even refuse to talk and&#xA0;answer the phone&#xA0;about the topic with others after some inquiry.&#xA0; Now, he hid himself in his own world and no one knows his thought.&#xA0;&#xA0; And&#xA0;we don&apos;t want to give too much pressure to crazy him.</p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; But the anxiety is still exist,&#xA0; so they turned&#xA0;to me&#xA0; to get more information because we work in the same city.&#xA0;I visit him&#xA0;each one or two monthes and talk for hours,&#xA0; we can talk many things except love.&#xA0;So what I tell them is my little&#xA0;brother is OK, don&apos;t worry about him. &#xA0;He even refuse me to meet me these two monthes because my visit is also pressure to him.&#xA0;&#xA0; Now, I have to receive many calls from family members to him.&#xA0; What I can do is blocked the calls, tell them don&apos;t worry about him and don&apos;t give some pressure to him. </p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; He&apos;s an independent man and he&apos;s eld enough to choose his own life, although I don&apos;t agree with his thought of love.&#xA0; I also understanding family members anxiety too.&#xA0; Maybe give him more time to decided what he want and give more pacify to my family members is the best choice for me.&#xA0; I hope my little brother will get his Miss right in the soon later.</p><p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </p>
