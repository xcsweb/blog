Now all the three colleagues of mine
promoted to senior teacher have made a monetary sacrifice to ease the envy of
others. For their monthly pay has been raised over 1,000 yuan, quite above the
others. First, Mr W was required to hand in ¥ 1,000 for all the staff to
take a dinner at a hotel. Then, Mr N, another senior one followed suit. Both were
compelled to do so and dared not show their reluctance. But the third one was
quite different because he volunteered to offer each of us a bag of dates imported
from Iraq. For some reasons I didn’t attend the dinners although I was invited.
I prefer the gift to the dinner.
