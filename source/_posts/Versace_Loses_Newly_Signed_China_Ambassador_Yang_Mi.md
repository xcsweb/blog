   On August 11,2019,Jiaxing Yang Mi studio issued a  statement to terminate the contract of Versace. The reason why they broke off the connection is that one of the Versace's T-shirt was printed Hong Kong is an independent country. That means Hong Kong isn't belongs to China.When this issue discovered by Chinese ,it caused a great disturbance and people's indignation on the internet. The first time she heard the new,she deleted all the microblogs which related to Vercase in only two hours.I think is was really amazing!   The rescission incident will cost Yang Mi and her company too much liquidated damages.And it will affact her fashion resources obviously in the future. But she gave up all at the first time without hesitated. Because she and her team both understood in the face of national interest ,everything is going to be unimportant include her capital.So she did a correct decision on this event.And it must be a reason why I loved and admired her forever. I also believe that each of Chinese would praise and support her sincerely.
