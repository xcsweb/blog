Today is sunny. The bad news is it will rain again tomorrow. What a long time that I have not jogged for weeks. This night I jog around for about one hour. How wonderful it is. When I was back, my clothes was totally soaked. After having bath, it is cool now.No one can predict when it will be sunny again. Everyone fully took a stroll in the noon after having lunch. The gentle sunshine cast on my face, the pulse of spring came into my heart. Quite enjoyable in face of warm breeze. Some blossoming flowers silently inform the arrival of this vital season.No matter how it rains, it is just the season which brings us hope and infinite longing.
