Another busy day slipped by. I am supposed
to have a laid-back life, to have a lot of time to rest. But supposed is a
trick word and you never know.  Here’s my schedule for today and you can
say it has nothing to do with laid-back.   Get up at 6:30, prepare breakfast, and then
drive my son to school. Spend two entire hours in tidying up the rooms. Considering
the fact that I had five days in hospital, and I have to say that is a hell of lot
work. Do the laundry, prepare and have lunch.  Then I go to the bank and the community
service center to prove one thing: I can’t afford my hospital bills and I need
help. Really it’s a simple math problem and even a primary school student can
tell that my family income is less than my hospital bills. Besides, when I started
my THP therapy, my doctor told me that if I paid 9 perjeta and I could get 10
for free. Nobody mentioned that “free” requires of an extremely complicate
process, which like the hospital, the insurance company, refuses any kind of reasonable
simplifying, even just for a simple math problem. This process involves my company,
my husband’s company, community service, the bank, my parents, Civil office bureau,
department of housing management….  So, that’s just a start. BTW, I haven’t got
my request approved by the community service, because the person in charge was
on a meeting.   Now when I finally come home, I have daily
learning to finish, dinner to prepare, a son to pick up, homework to check….

Time always rushes by in the hustle and bustle of life,  anyway, anytime and anyhow.
