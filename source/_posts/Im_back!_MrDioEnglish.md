forgot when i meeted you.with a purpose of adding the way of learning English, I was in search of an English community on the network. At that time, as a junior student, passing cet-6 was my task which I must finish. The various websites were showed to my computer's screen, and I chose you www.DioEnglish.com(DE)Â one month last year, I succeeded, and my score was 431. To be honest, the achievement was just a little gain, but I was still very joyful. may you ask if DE have its function in my prepare for cet-6? emm........maybe have or haven'twhatever,this quetion is not a quetion, and because I don't care hahahah.long time not to use my PC, so I open it ,surfing the internet, meanwhile, logging in DE, writing a blog, sharing some emotionsahhh, my ability of English seem to be falling, declining,dropping, yayayayaya
