Don’t throw away the leftovers, please,
which may be taken when you are in need tomorrow.  

君之餘餐切莫棄，誰料明日膓中饑。You'd better not divorce your wife
sharing distress with you, or you'll feel regret and lonely when past your frivolous
prime.  

勸君勿休糟糠妻，少壯輕狂老空寂。Why are you so envious of others but self-abased？ You should prize what you have
as gifts from Heaven.  

何羡他人而自鄙，天賦與汝當珎惜。
