    I am stuck in the new project for two weeks that I have no single minute sitting here for writing something, during the past two week, it is really a tough time for me so that I have to work overtime very late. It almost reached my limited that I can endure, fortunately, the National Day is coming then I can relax a short time. The most busy days will be on at the end of October and it is a terrible period our team and I will be going through. Everyone knows that we are always shorthanded and require the ability of handling multitasks at the same time, no doubt, it will provide us opportunities to showing off in front of big boss, but, the challenge is you will be keeping on going and always full of energy. It is not everyone can handle it, I think I still have a long way to go for the new role in this project, not only fearing my English if can communicate with customer, also worrying my working style if can suit this position. I already prepared to take this test no matter the result is good or bad, I would like to give a shot to test myself if can go on this way jumping out of comfort zone. If I always satisfy my current working content, I will lose further ascending space in company.    Anyway, I should fight for this chance. Change is hard at first, messy in the middle and so gorgeous at the end.
