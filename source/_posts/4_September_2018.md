A change of my job
Just before the third period Mr W hinted to me he would have a word with me as soon as I was free. Somehow I had a premonition of an unpleasant thing. Later he went to the classroom where I was conducting a class. Being aware of his intention, I walked outdoors to him. He conveyed discreetly principals' new decision to me. I had been assigned to a new post, the sanitation worker of the schoolyard. He said I might accept or reject the assignment. I showed no disagreement on the matter. He added that from tomorrow I can start my new job and needn’t give any lesson at all.
