This is
Saturday, the final day of this week. Whatever it may be also the second last day,
based on our own calculating habit in China. 

A question does
not stop running around my brain, which is how to get a score like 7 or 8 of
IELTS. Normally it shall not be difficult for me, as I think I’m a linguistic expert
of the company where I’m working. My job is to handle the communication problems with
foreign customs and local authority such as  in africa, such as writing them by mails, telephoning them in case of
emergency, as well as preparing bid document and contract agreement etc. in English
or French. 

To pass
IELTS exam, is like a preparation to a “war” or project initiating. Firstly,
the most important thing or the priority is to choose an appropriate strategy. 

An exam is
an exam, not such big or meaning like a war or a project, but equally complex
as them. A certain amount of vocabulary for the exam covers generally 6000 core
words with the other about 10 000 ~ 20 000 words of so-called commonsense. 

Four different
sections of the exam are listening, reading, writing and speaking. Listening is
the most worrying for me, which needs non-stop practicing of long term, even
though that is what I’m working on. Reading and writing is relatively familiar,
because this is part of my job, although my job just covers a tiny range of
civil engineering. Speaking could be a real challenge, because of nearly no
chance, no circumstance of speaking while living and working in Shanghai. 

An
appropriate strategy shall help me do the preparation covering all the above mentioned
for a limited period like one more month. Secondly, that is to practice what i plan as per the strategy chosen. So all of the things after the determination of the strategy is practicing, practicing, practicing for the "war" in order to  access into the war relaxingly and leisurely,  and to get a score, a satisfying score, the final target .
