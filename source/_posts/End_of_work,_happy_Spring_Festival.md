Today is the last working day in the year of dog. After turning off the computer, I went back. On the way home, the wind was warm and I did not see many guys. It was sunny in the day and warm enough to feel that spring would be coming soon. For me, it is normal to enjoy on this holiday. Time is limited, so I do seize every moment to make full use of it. I have prepared well for the Kindle that I have downloaded e-books then I can read in the coming days. The more I read, the tinier I feel I am. Interesting, I really did not know that. Now I feel it is truly correct. Have fun.
