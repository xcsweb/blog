*After a long time stopping work, the road lamps began to give light on my way this evening.
*Took a new route back home. The dirt path I usually take to avoid the heavy traffic in the busy street is too rugged to cycle on it. Recently I've found large heaps of dry grasses by the road not far from home. I decided to carry several bundles back with the trike every day from work. The traffic jam in the main street is intensifying with the heating company laying underground pipes at the crossroads near the Preferential Supermarket. The new route is opened to connect the housing estate named L with the West Mountain village .
