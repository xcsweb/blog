    Finally, I can have a short break even I apply two-day off next week for relaxation, I know the happy time will be very short, because the end of this month, our customer will audit us again. Currently, I don't know what will happen for this round of audit, I sincerely hope it could get a good result and make a good impression to customer. Anyway, I should be lived in the moment and also I should try to make myself happy even the environment around us not so friendly. Sometimes, I may involve into bad mood under big pressure or something I can't handle well. During the past several weeks, I work overtime so frequent that I can't have a good rest. I plan to gradually lower the overtime frequency when the new production line is running smooth and also I need to take enough training to learn something regarding the new line.I actually don't know how to create a new program or debug it by myself. Actually, I have the feeling that the new task will quickly befall me no matter I am willing to accept or not. Even I already take the psychological preparation to take this responsibility, I believe before new colleague is on board, I can't reduce my work loading as long as I work here.    To be honest, I am getting busy this year than last year, but, I am not getting well paid even don't get yearly pay raise that all of us is expected since the beginning of this year
