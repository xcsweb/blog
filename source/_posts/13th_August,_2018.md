The first day of another new semester for the staff. School begins next week. We had a heavy shower yesterday. I started out early to avoid the predicted moderate rain. I finished the drizzly journey under the protection of the raincoat. I begrudge riding my new bike in such weather. So I rode the old instead. I heard my colleagues arriving one after another and greeting each other. Mr S's forced laughter was still loud and easily recognizable. Three new members joined us. We were set free after having lunch. I have a completely different teaching task this term.
