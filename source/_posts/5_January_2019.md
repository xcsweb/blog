The arrival of Lesser Cold marks the
beginning the coldest days of a year.

Saw the famous Indian film A Tramp again on
TV by accident. It was still attractive to me. It is black and white indicating
its long history. It first appeared in the early 1980s. The interlude song of
Larz, who is hero of the film, was very popular at that time. It was often
heard hummed by the youngsters. I still remember its tune and part of its
words. I had no chance to go to the cinema and only appreciated it by listening
to the radio at first. Later, I could watch its original version on the
computer. Its music, dance and the actors' lines are really unforgettable.
