It has got cool after the arrival of the White
Dew and our wear feels thin. The moonlight comes closer and the sky seems to
step back far away.

白露轉凉衣覺單，月光移近天顯逺。

Perhaps some locals of my native village
are looking up at the moon and wondering when the distant traveler may come
back.

故鄉幾人須仰頭，或念逰子何時還。
