One purpose of this US
trip was visiting Yellow Stone Park, which is the biggest park in the world. We
were told at least three or four days to follow the line number 8 every corners
of the park if you want to visit it deeply. I can say we were the lucky birds
because of snowing in October as beautiful as this are few and far between as
local people said, all roads were just opened, seemed that they know and
welcome we are coming now.

Let our tourists knows
that you may have to book the hotel in advance if you want to live in the park
in high seasons, otherwise it is inconvenient in and out by car, Foods and
Beverages inside are quite expensive than others.

Each parks before we
visit, we would like to go to the service centre first, just let us know some
information of park, how and where we can start it, where is the most light spots
and features. Unbelievable the signal of cell phone was not good in the park,
that means you have to take GPS for guiding.

At the heart of
Yellowstone’s past, present and future lies a super volcano, huge volcanic
eruptions occurred here, the heat powering those eruptions still fuels the park’s
geysers, hot springs, fumaroles and mud pots. Hot springs are the most common
hydrothermal features in the park, They vary from frothing mocha-like boiling
water to clear and calm pools of tremendous depth, hot springs have no
constrictions, so water rises, cools and sinks freely. 

Old Faithful is more
than its namesake world famous geyser (top photo), you can view hundreds of
other geysers and hot springs.

You have the rare
opportunity to view animals who are wild, they behave like their ancient
ancestors, as you know if the traffic in the park, only reason is the animals
are tired and lying on the road maybe for a day or more, to be human being we
have to say nothing and wait, due to this is their areas. Enjoy watching
animals but stay safe, they are wild and dangerous really.

Every corner of
Yellowstone reveals the park’s rich array of nature and history.
