In this Asian
country, a man should marry into his wife's family; and
a woman may have several husbands. 

亚洲此国的男人要“嫁给”女人，女子可有多个丈夫 

 Located on the southern slope of the Himalayas,
Bhutan, one of China's neighbors, is acclaimed as the Last Shangri-La.

不丹被誉为“最后的香格里拉”，是中国的邻国，位于喜马拉雅山脉南坡。Thanks to the closed geographical conditions,
the customs and habits there still keep in place.

由于地理环境的封闭，这里的风俗习惯得以保留。In the streets of Bhutan, it's a common sight that women
are dressed in the traditional Keira skirts and men in robes.

走在不丹的大街上，随处可见女子身穿传统服饰“基拉”裙，男子身穿名为“帼”的传统长袍。
