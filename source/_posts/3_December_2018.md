The forecast rain didn’t come except for a few drops.
Unusually warm. The ice of the skating rink had almost melted off. A stretch of lower playground close to the rink had been soaked through for a large amount of water had seeped into that part. This would not have happened if an extensive piece of plastics had been spread on the bottom of the rink. The cabbages are still left outdoors with coverings. 
Loading the collected empty beer bottles on the back seat of my bike, headed for Mr W’s. He’s a shopkeeper at his village. Once I overheard his saying that some of his customers had failed to return the beer bottles with the brand name Snowflake.
