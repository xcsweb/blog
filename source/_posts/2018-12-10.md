	also store information in magnetic particles embedded in removeable disk that may be floppy or rigid floppy disks store less information than a hard disk frive and retrieve the information at a much slower rate magneto optical disk frive and retrieve the information at a much slower rate drives store info on removable discs that are sensitive to both laser light and magnetic firlds they can typically srore as mych information as hard disk but have slightly slower retrieval speeds compact disc store info on pits burned into the surface of a dise of reflective material the info stored on cd can not be erased or overwritten with new info they can store about as much info as a hard frive but have a slower rarte of info retreieval	memory refers to the comp chips that store info for quick retrieval by the cpu random access memory is used to store info and instructions that ooerate the com programs typically programs are transferred from storage on a disk frive to ram is also known as volatile memory because the info within cp ship is lost when power to the cp is turned ooff read only memory contains critical innfo and software that must be permanently avaulable for computer operation such as the operating system that directs the computers actions from start upÂ  to shut down rom called nonvolatile memory because the memory cguos do not lose the info when power to the co is turned off	some devices serve more than one purpose for example floppy disk may also be used as input devices if they contain info to be use and processd by the computer user in addition they can be used as output devices if the user wants to store the results of computation on them,	hardware Connections	to function,hardware requires physical cinnections that allow components to communicate and interact a bus orivudes a common interconnected system composed of a group of wires or circuitry coordinates and moves info between the internal parts of a computer a computer bus consists of 2 channels one that the cpu uses to locate data called the address bus , and another to send the data to that address called the data bus a bus is characterized by 2 features how much info it can manipulatea at one time called the bus width and how quickly it can transfer there data	a seical connection is a wire or set of wires used to ransfer information from the cpu to an external device such as a mouse keyboard modem scanner and some types of printers this type of connection transfers only one piece of data at a time and is therefore slow the advantage of using a sesical connection is that it provides effective connections over long distances	a parallel connection usess multiple sets of wires to ransfer blocks of info simultaneously most scanners and printers use this type if connection a parallel connection is mych faster than a serical connection but it is limited to distances of less than 3 between the cpu and the external device
