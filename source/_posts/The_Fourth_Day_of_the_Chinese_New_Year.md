      In Chinese, today belongs to the Kitchen God. In different region in China, people may have different customs to celebrate it.One of the traditions on this day is eating “Zheluo”(putting left-over of the dishes together into a meal.) This means that people will never waste food, in hoping that the Kitchen God could see this and may do good for people.     The Kitchen God is said to report his work to the Jade Emperor commenting on human good and evil, until the 4th day of New Year to return back to the earth.Chinese folk saying goes :” Send-off early, welcome late.” so that the Kitchen God need to be sent off in the morning, while to welcome at about four o’clock in the afternoon.     In the north area of China, a legend also said that, on this day, Kitchen God would be down checking the household, therefore , it should be not away from home, and there is also a similar custom which forbids closing doors in case the God not able get in.     Wish everyone have a happy new year.
