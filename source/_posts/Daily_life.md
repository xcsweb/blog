Though my daily life is extremely monotonous， I try hard to adapt myself to it。 Why? Because I intend to be a good worker。　　I get up at six o’clock every day。 After I wash my face and brush my teeth， I begin to review my work list。 I go to work at seven o’clock。[由Www.DuanMeiWen.Com整理]　　After work is over， I return home。 We usually have supper at seven o’clock。Then I begin to read some books ,I want to finish it before I go to bed。
