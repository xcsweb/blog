He neither lingered here nor went to my boudoir
exchanging intimacies with me. 既来不須臾，又不處重闈；
If
only I could fly to him on the wind like a bird!



亮無晨風翼，焉能凌風飛？
I have to stretch my neck looking into the
distance for diverting myself from the anxiety.

眄睐以適意，引領遥相睎。
Feeling depressed about my wretched fate, I lean
on the chamber doors weeping. 



徙倚懷感傷，垂涕沾雙扉。
