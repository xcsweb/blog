Technology is making people lazy. Now when doing
laundry, we switch on the washing machine instead of using our hands. We move
on wheels instead of on foot. To calculate, we use the electronic calculator instead
of our brains or abacus. Before the invention of TV, people walked miles in
order to see a movie. But now we lie in bed enjoying TV programs right at home,
showing no interest in the theatre. The keyboard of computer is instead of hand
writing. Washing machine, cars, TV, Computer and some other modern inventions
are keeping us away from exercise.
