    It seems not a good beginning of this year, it should be sent out envelope of five hundred for every employee at the first working day failed to receive till now. What's worse, how averagely percent of raise still not published? If everything goes as plan, it should be published regarding salary raise ratio in last monthly employee communication meeting, if it still isn't clear in the next meeting, that means the actual situation will more worse than imagination. Even though according to current forecast, we are still profitable at the end of this year. The difference is the profit that will be lower than last year and it is also not big boss expectation. That's the reason why the big boss starts to cost down at the beginning of this year, currently, we are not sure whether it affects the bonus that should be given in next monthly salary, but, we should prepare to live a hard life in the next few months will be common unless the marketing requirement goes up in the second half of this year. We can't predict the future trend of developing, but, we are definitely hoping our company can always keep upward trend.    Sometimes, we are not happy company's culture and fairness, but, at every critical moment, we absolutely stand on the company side, after all, we only share benefits based on company's prosperity. Anyway, we hope the big boss can bring company going on rising ladder.
