When I got to school, it had been 9 o'clock. The shower in the early morning delayed my departure for school. As I started, it was drizzling. But it soon turned thick and fast and lasted for quite some time. My clothes and shoes still kept dry under the watery raincoat thanks to the absence of wind. Then the rain subsided again. The lunch consisted of eggs fried with sauce, cooked corn-cobs and potatoes. The cobs were bought  at ¥0.40 each rather than picked at the garden. The ears on the stalks are too small and need some time to grow for our eating.
