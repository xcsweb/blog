I have been stripped to the waist recently when I am at home. But today was different. I was greeted by the cooler wind coming through the opened back window. As a result, I began to run at the nose and sneeze as well. Then I had to put on one of my T-shirts welcoming the first appearance of the autumn wind. However, outside the sunlight was still fiery.
Found a lot of rolled sheets of straw deserted outside the slaughterhouse near our bungalow in the dim light. I spent two hours carrying almost all of them back with my wheelbarrow. They are good fuels.
