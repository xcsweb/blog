I killed time before the TV and computer
day and night. My deserted Confucian classics have been covered with a thick
layer of dust.

日夜屏前付流水，詩書閒置被塵灰。Now that I've realized my misbehavior, I must
mend my ways at once from tonight. I continued my daytime reading by candle-light when darkness
set in. 

知錯當改今夕始，焚膏油兮以繼晷。
