Sister Straw Hat had ever promised to build a school for the children in some poverty‐stricken region. 

草帽姐曾在以前许诺，一定会为贫困区的孩子们盖一所学校。But she has not only failed to keep her word after success but grudged making any donation.

但是成名以后的她不仅没有盖什么学校，甚至都舍不得捐款!She has moved into a high‐grade residence, driving a luxury car and wearing miscellaneous fashions
of famous brands.

草帽姐搬进了高级住宅，不仅开着豪车，而且身穿各种各样的时尚名牌。She can be a genuine lady when taking off her
straw hat. 

生活中的草帽姐摘掉草帽后，就可谓是一名名副其实的贵妇人了。Wang Erni hasn’t forgotten her origin after success
in the Avenue of Stars.

王二妮从星光大道成名后，她并没有忘本，Besides repaying her fellow countrymen, she has
also been enthusiastically devoting herself to major public welfare
undertakings, setting up Wang Erni Special Fund for Students and raising public
fund for hearing‐impaired children.

不仅回报了家乡的父老乡亲，而且还一直积极投身各大公益事业，还成立“王二妮助学专项基金”，为听障儿童募集公益基金!
