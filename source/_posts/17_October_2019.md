The cuckoo bird is named Dujuan in poetry. Its
chirping solemnly reminds me of the remote past.

布谷詩名作杜鵑，叫聲綿邈思愀然。

Although I was acquainted with the bird’ s twittering,
I didn’t know its scientific name at all in my childhood. Forty⁃odd years have
passed since just like an instant.  

童雉不識其稱謂，恍惚已過四十年。
