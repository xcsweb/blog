A calligraphy class should not be visited
by others for they would affect the lecturer. We canâ€™t judge a teacher only by one
of his classes. A lecturer can temporarily win the praise of the judges and
visitors by making careful preparations and having rehearsals in advance. This might
give people a false impression for it could be quite different from his routine
work. When a teacher tends to please his visitors in class, he will ignore his
students and leave his usual practical way. To evaluate the job of a teacher,
the right way is to see how well his students can do their work in or after
class.
