Master Xuanzang began to travel around the country for studying the Buddhist scriptures of Great Vehicle and Little Vehicle after becoming a monk. Because of the incomplete introductions of the scriptures, different masters offered different explanations. He was too perplexed to know which was true. In order to comprehend the scriptures correctly, he determined to head west for the birthplace of Buddhism for the original. Without being permitted by Emperor Taizong of the Tang dynasty, he stole across the national border seeking the truth abroad. The journey was long, difficult and dangerous, especially through the lifeless 800-mile across desert. Thanks to his profound belief in Buddhism, he spent four years reaching his destination.
