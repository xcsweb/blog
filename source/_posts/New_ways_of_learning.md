One of my new year resolutions in 2019
is to run half-marathon. It’s a bit challenging for me cause so far, the
longest distance I’ve ever run is 5 Kms, which I run regularly, still we are
talking about half-marathon here--four times plus.  So, I check APP KEEP, finding that there
is a 56-days detailed training plan for running half-marathon. I even found a runner
circle in WeChat mini program “Check-in“ (小打卡)，which so far is the best facilitator for
anything I want to keep at.  In these days, if you want to develop yourself,
you could almost find anything you need in the internet—from learning program
to the learning community—and even better, most of them are free or charged a
little—honestly, comparing to the fees for those after-classes of my son, that
“little” can be totally ignored.   For example, I want to acquire some
basic financial knowledge, and there is one program in QK charged you 9.9 yuan
in total—9.9 yuan, seriously? I am always in for those beautiful journals,
which is known as 手帐 in Chinese, and I found one
program, and it only cost me 19 yuan.   There are also many circles (sort of
learning community) in “Check-in“ free to join in,
which almost cover everything, from reading to writing, from exercising to art
and almost anything in between.  My son likes drawing. However, you know
the kids, they hardly settle for anything, and they are kind of scattered and
even sometimes self-sabotaging.  Last summer holiday, I introduced him
into one of the art circles, where you upload your pictures daily.  It intrigued him almost at once. During last
summer holiday, we drew pictures together and uploaded them to the Internet. He
always received more likes than me—which encouraged him even more. It’s really
a wonderful experience.  We are now in an age where knowledge has
no longer only stored in the teachers’ minds and you have to go to the school
to learn.  It’s an information surplus era and
knowledge is close at hand.  









































As long as you want to learn, you can
and you will, at any time, at any place.
