Last night on TV watched a special program on the legendary footballer Drogba. I was fascinated by his heroic physical strength and brilliant performance in the games. He's from Ivory Coast, a small country in west Africa. He has ever joined many different clubs across the world. He distinguished himself mainly by playing for Chelsea. For three times he helped the Ivory Coast qualify for FIFA World Cup. His plea for a cease fire was accepted bilaterally by the warring parties in his native country. As a philanthropist he also donated a large sum to his country for the construction of a hospital.
