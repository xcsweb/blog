At one time, I did not love running. I could hardly breathe in a 1000-meter-test. My lungs were almost to explod and I painfully prayed it would end as soon as possible. Last weekend, after covering a 16km-distance jog, I was excited and did not sense tiredness. The potential of human beings is marvellous. I can run longer and shorten the time consumed during a jog.I choose to run since it is not that hard 
to achieve. Only should I do is to keep steping forward and controlling 
the pace. Particularly, in a long distance jogging, I freely focus on 
mediation on the way. Easy, isn't it? It is no great shakes so long as I
 hang in there. No more sophisticated skills I am about to master. Just run. But we are likely to fail it if we are not ready to 
endure the solitude, setback, aches on the running way. While that is 
the right part which exactly attracts me to go on. After conquering a jog, I succeed ascending to a new stage.Generally, in the opposite, we'd like being doing nothing. And everything seems to come true as long as we want it. How terrible it is. As mortals, we just can not be rewarded by paying nothing. Even though we still try to own it. Poorly, if so we live in a world of imagination.
