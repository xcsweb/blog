After passing the examination and verification
of the relevant departments, the martyrs' children can be
recommended for admission to some colleges connected with the public security
system, so long as they have received nine years of compulsory education and
not been over twenty-two years of age by the time of taking the college entrance examination.
The universities not only exempt them from charge of tuition but grant them a
monthly allowance as a return for their sacrificed parents. After graduation,
they will be immediately assigned to work in corresponding departments. 

如果是烈士的子女，接受了九年义务教育，而且在高考的时候年龄没有超过22周岁，相关部门通过审核之后就可以保送，这些孩子会被送到公安系统相关的大学，大学期间不用付学费，而且每个月有补助，也算是给烈士们一个好的交代吧，毕业之后会安排到相应的部门直接工作。
