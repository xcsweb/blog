First a sage should be a virtuous person among the common people. He is not ashamed of his low status and never complains about it. He has no desire to distinguish himself. He prefers to do all things according to his conscience rather than please anyone only. Mr Hale was such a gentleman. He gave up the position of a clergyman, which had ever brought him a comfortable income, because he had grave doubts about the faith he had followed. He couldnâ€™t reaffirm his former faith in Christianity as the bishop demanded. He would have felt guilty to preach the sermons to the congregation.
