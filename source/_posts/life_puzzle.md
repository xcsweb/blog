 What is happyness? Why we feel not really happy? Work loading, survival pressure, limited spare time, emotional issue these all puzzled me a lot. Whether I like or dislike these problem, I have to face them! That is why i think i am not easy to be happy! How to get out of these troublesome, i used to feel fragile of myself. Sometimes life is really hard. I hold on the hopeless job and dare not to change it as before.  Finding a life-time career is not that easy. It is lucky to find the clear career developing path. But I myself can not clear see the future road. I got setback. I was failure for hunsands and thonsands times. I may be regarded as a loser before or even now. But I know I am never never never never give up the life pursuing.
