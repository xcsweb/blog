I favor the attitude to take it easy. I like
the slow pace of life in the countryside. I hate to be urged to do something. I
appreciate the saying once learnt that the man dies in a hurry who lives a fast
pace of life and the one passes away leisurely who leads a slow life. Currently,
many people are complaining about an exhausting life. We feel a deep sympathy
for those who have to overwork because of the pressure to make a living. But most
of them have fallen victim to vanity and been reduced to slaves of life. Let us
put aside the chores and duty at hand and have a good rest enjoying some
leisure deserved.Â
