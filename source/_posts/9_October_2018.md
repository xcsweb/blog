On my arrival at school Mr W assigned me to
remove the heaps of weeds in front of the south house on behalf of our
principal. He said I needn’t conduct any class today. The first important was
to clear the heaps as quickly as possible. There will be some kind of
inspection from above tomorrow.

The green-leaved corn stems that stand in
the fields have almost been frozen to death.

Felt a little warmer today with the newly-worn
long-sleeved upper underwear and the western-styled outer garment which is
usually put on in spring and autumn. But this one is particular, and it’s the
upper part of my wedding suit twenty-odd years ago. It’s open near the breast and
can’t be buttoned for keeping out the cold headwind.
