These days I was extremely busy, the first snow in
Beijing of this year, many of people were looking forward the day coming in
this winter, as all know many of cities near Beijing has had the snow for a
week, as per weather forecast it should be had early in Beijing area, it was
too late till yesterday morning it was finally have a little snow, the people
went out to take the pictures as many as they can. But I did not have much mood
to enjoy the beautiful sightseeing; no passion to enjoy covered with snow, what
I was busy is for Tiger.

 After Chinese New Year, Tiger was ready for the
hospital, I liked taking a baby with his stuffs at the early morning, It was so
complicated for living the hospital I realized this time, we went to see the doctor
first to get the notification and then we should go the long queue in the
counter for deposit payment, at least 5000 yuan to frozen your credit card
expense, after that we would go to the other counter to get the wristband for
patient, it likes the permission card for in and out of hospital, at the last
before you went to the inpatient ward, you have to buy the meal coupon for
three meals a day.

 Luckily I am much better than other family members of
patient whose are from other province, they looked so stubborn for asking some
questions in their totally unfamiliar area, you can see from their face were so
upset. So for me everything was getting smoothly for Tiger, I can say Tiger is
so luck has me around him.

 

I caught a long breath after finishing all the
procedures about two hours, I was sitting on the chair to have a look throw the
window, Snowing was still falling down, yes, it was so beautiful day ,isn’t it?
