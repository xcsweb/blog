Comrade Zhong Yang had been a professor and a
doctoral supervisor at the College of Life Science of Fudan University before
his death. With the ideal to serve our country with science and technology, he
had dedicated his life to the research and protection on biodiversity for so
long. He had led his team collecting tens of millions of plant seeds for the
National Gene Bank from the Tibetan Plateau. With morally oriented Â self-cultivating, pursuing
studies and teaching, he had tried his best to help his students grow into talent.
Travelling across the remotest and the most hostile places of the region during
the hard sixteen years in aid of Tibet, he had made great
contributions to talent training, disciplinary construction and scientific
research in the west minority nationality regions.
