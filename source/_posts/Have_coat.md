It is getting cold after the rain. Absolutely, it is the time to have coat. I have my shirt with long sleeves from this week. Just last weekend, I had T-shirt. This trending speeds the leaves to fall down and more deciduous trees will have the autumn style by changing green leaves into red and yellow color. The enthusiasm of life never ends regardless of season changing. When I run, I feel cool by sweating on the way. At the first beginning, I sense a little bit cold, but I just feel the warmth from the heart beating and do not find it hard to move any more further as long as I want to run.I rarely have a cold. The main reason  I assume is that I exercise regularly. And I believe the truth life really lies in movement. If you rest a lot, you terribly rust.
