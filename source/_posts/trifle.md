It is late summer day but it is still hot. Even I know that the autumn season will follow suit soon as the mid-summer festival is upcoming with only one month left.Â Autumn season is always cool and pure cloudy. It is good for moutain climbing too.Every this moment of the year, It reminds me time flies! As people said after the mid-autumn, new year is almost there!I really want to take a sigh and refresh myself.I hope Good!
