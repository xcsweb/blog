A gang of guys in the morning walked out the elevator, yawning all the way till they disspeared in the lobby. The smell of cigarettes were still left in the elevator. They had been playing mahjong all night. I do not know what is the good of mahjong. But later, I sense everything has its magic. If you are really into it, you find it, then you can never easily get out of it. When one of these guys won in that play of mahjong, he definitely felt great and excited. And other gamblers were surely to try winning back. The experience of rush of adrenaline due to the cause of winning in a game is quite amazing. It makes the winner feel high in the sky. This never ends till all is exhausted and some got their money totally lost in the game.
