We’re inclined to prize what we haven’t but ignore that we have. We’re justified to be proud of our
continuous civilization about five thousand years. Our ancient Confucianism,
medicine and architecture are still playing important roles in the modern life.
Adhering to the instructions of Confucianism, we can behave properly for
establishing harmonious families and a civilized society. However, a lot of our
nationals have turned followers of Buddhism and Christianity from abroad. Moreover,
huge sums of money have been spent building many magnificent Buddhist temples
across the country. Such way of acting at present seems to be a reversal of
host and guest. As for our ancient medicine and architecture, they are the
treasures passed down from our ancestors and we must carry out our duties of
cultural inheritance because they are unique in the world.
