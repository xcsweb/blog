It would snow both on the morning and the evening in December in
Qinling Mountains. The children started for school just before daybreak. The
kids from the same village would go in company. The big yellow dogs of the
families would substitute for the parents working outside escorting their
little masters. They bustled back and forth loyally and vigilantly and never
returned until seeing their young owners enter the school.

Reading, the school staff and the student body would go jogging on the country
road. Headmaster S said taking exercise outside was because there was no
playground at the school. In spite of the backwardness of the hardware
conditions, he added, the educational concept must keep pace with the times；keeping fit and safe both
physically and mentally would be of the first importance forever.
