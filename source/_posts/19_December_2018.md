The Battalion of Astronauts of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a unit of heroes on a special mission. The group of
astronauts is a heroic team growing with the development of our country's space program. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, all the
astronauts have been keeping   firmly in
mind the expectations and great trust of the Party and people, dreaming of
China becoming a military power, determined to devote their lifetime to the
space industry; they have commanded the skills of space flight by intensive
studying and hard training and forged ahead realizing innovative great-leap-forward development. The battalion has successfully
completed six manned space flight missions one after another in the twenty
years after its formation, making an outstanding contribution to the project.
