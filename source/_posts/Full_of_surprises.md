My swimming performance do poorly in my mind at this
year, my pose of free style swimming is uncomfortable, 1km is about 28-29
minutes, only one time I remembered was within 27 minutes. I do self inspection
sometime why my speed is slower than my frog swim, it should not be like that, maybe
my arms are not straight enough, or maybe my footwork is not in right way. I
checked one reference report from one swimming material for female, my result
is only in middle level, but I have enough staying power and I have loved and
kept swimming for many years, why my performance is not my expectation.

This morning I went to swimming pool as usual, maybe
it was too early, nobody there, the pool like making a block booking for myself,
when I was so happy to see the quiet pool, but I found I forgot bring my
swimming glasses and cap, how come? I have never swam without the both, it took
much time if I went back home to take it. I was trying to find the cap at the
corner in the locker room instead; luckily there was the one, although it was
too small for my long hair, no any choice. 

I have never swam without my swimming glasses, I cannot swim when I was
in the water, I had to close my eyes like a blind dog, but gradually I fit the
situation and swimming freely to forward my body as fast as I can. I checked my
code water, I cannot believe only 25 minutes for 1km, which is my new record
for sure, it was full of surprise just by the accident, the story told us if
you want to reach the gaol which you did many times before, but always come to
nothing, then you might try thinking other ways to go, the big surprise will
come to you. Please believe me.
