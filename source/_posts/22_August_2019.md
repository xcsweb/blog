The unseen insects are chirping incessantly
in the green autumn fields.

秋虫鳴不絶，田野猶碧色。I wonder before the thick grasses and crops
why you have been lamenting so ceaselessly. 

敢問紗帳裏，何故久歎嗟?We can see a blue sky at last after so long
a period of rainy weather. I’m pedaling in the deep shade of green trees. 

久雨放晴空，踏車緑䕃中。The front leaves of my unbuttoned shirt are
just like fluttering wings. And passing by my ears is the whistling wind. 

敞襟飄若翼，耳際聞風聲。
