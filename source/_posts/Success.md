Many successful people say that they own much of their
success to the cultivation of certain qualities in early life. Honesty is the
best policy. If you are honest to others, they will be kind to you in return.
Industry is another key factor of success. Hardly could any success be achieved
without labouring. Success is simply the fruit of work. In addition, enthusiasm
is a great force. Oneâ€™s soul will expand if one devotes oneself to a noble
cause. The last but not the least, thrift is a wise guide to all. If you pay
attention to these four things: honest, industry, enthusiasm and thrift. You are
on your way to success.
