I like swimming since many years ago, not only it
doesn’t like running which is making me so sweat and a little bit tired each
time, but also I like be a fish in the water freely, I have never missing any
chances for swimming, such as going to the beach or the seaside or any hotel
with pool facility, there must be have my body there.

I do care my swimming report regarding swimming motion
sensor: check detailed swim metrics such as laps, strokes, time and speed, and
calculate a SWOLF score to show swim efficiency from Garmin watch. I only can
swim of frog style and free style, I think well of myself for frog, it is more
easy for me, but free style which is always challenge for me, every time if I
played 1000 meters, among 800-900 meters I practiced more in free style, I
learned it must be match of your arms and legs with your breath, but I don’t
know where I was wrong of body, even I watched a lot videos how to swim and
listening the trainer to tell the main tips on line, in reality it is hard to
change my way.

One morning, When I was swimming as usual, one boy was
sitting in the corner who is the lifeguard of this fitness, I saw him before
but never talk, You know I am a sunshine lady, I like talking with others first,
the rather the boy is handsome, I asked him please give me some comments of my
swim, where is my problem? how can I swim faster? The boy told me with his smiling
face, you have many problems which we called bugs, and then he told me how to
do in detail from head, arm and leg, he set an example and demonstrated to me patiently.
I was trying remembered all what he said in each words, including how to turn
back fast in the pool, come to an understanding all of a sudden.

I tried to change my old way swimming these day, and
tasting the points and following his words, after one week later, yesterday
morning the report told me 26 minutes with 1000 meter, which was faster 2
minutes than before, I cannot believe this is truth.

I was so happy to know I can realize my potential if I do much efforts.
