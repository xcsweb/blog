Here comes the National Day.Â I have not written some here for more than one month. The main reason is I was fascinated by reading. Much of the time is occupied on books. The more I read, the less I feel that I know the world. Amazing, isn't it? Actually as an individual, I am only a tiny little person as in a sand in the desert.National Day comes and many will pay a visit going somewhere either hometown or some resorts. Every time, it is a test to see if visitors have enough patience and energy to endure this hard and painful trip. Most of the time, they are on the way to wait for something, such as keeping the line in a train or a coach station, ordering a seat for in a restaurant or a hotel. etc. They are either waiting or on the way to wait. Wait, wait and wait. But it does not stop the enthusiasm of visitors. Anyway, we are seldom on a longer vacation than this. The the treading is unstoppable, many guys still join in the army of tourists.Have fun.
