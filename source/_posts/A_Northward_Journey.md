A Northward March 

北征In the autumn of the second year under the reign of Emperor Suzong, i.e. on the first
day of the leap month after the eighth by the lunar calendar,皇帝二載秋，閠八月初吉。I'll head north for a wartime trip home.






杜子將北征，蒼茫問家室。On this occasion of difficulty and danger, both the courtiers and
the common people have no leisure at all. 

維時遭艱虞，朝野無暇日。I feel ashamed that His Majesty has done me a favor to grant me
leave for my humble home.

顧慙恩私被，詔許歸蓬蓽。I go to the court taking farewell of His Majesty and linger there
long in fear and trembling before departure. 

拜辭詣闕下，怵惕久未出。In spite of a lack of the air of an admonitor, I'm still
afraid that the emperor may have some oversights and omissions.  雖乏諫諍姿，恐君有遺失。



 Your Majesty is really an emperor who can restore our nation for
you're
endowed with the ability to administer a country and have dedicated your life
to the cause.

君誠中興主，經緯固密勿。I'm righteously angry at the rebellion of the minorities which has
not been put down up to now.东胡反未已，臣甫憤所切。I'm unwilling to tear myself away from our emperor's
temporary dwelling place. But finally I have to take a tearful leave. Later on
my way I'm still in a trance. 

揮涕戀行在，道途猶恍惚。When can our emperor and his subjects get rid of the sufferings
from the social calamity？ 

乾坤含瘡痍，憂虞何時畢？I slowly pass the paths across the desolate fields sparsely
populated.

靡靡踰阡陌，人煙眇蕭瑟。



 Many of the people I meet on my way are wounded, groaning and bleeding.

所遇多被傷，呻吟更流血。Looking back to the county town of Fengxiangxian, I find the flags
there now visible, now hidden in the evening.

回首鳳翔縣，旌旗晚明滅。As I climb one mountain after another on my way forward, watering holes for battle steeds often come into sight. 

前登寒山重，屢得飮馬窟。The Jing River flows across the basin at the northern outskirts of
Bingzhou City.

邠郊入地底，涇水中蕩潏。In front of me are scattered large rocks like crouching tigers,
whose roaring would crack the grey cliffs around. 

猛虎立我前，蒼崖吼時裂。The autumn chrysanthemums have come into bloom in the mountains. Old
ruts are left on the stone road.

菊垂今秋花，石戴古車轍。Both
the blue clouds and the peaceful scenes are pleasant and refreshing. 

青雲動高興，幽事亦可悦。
