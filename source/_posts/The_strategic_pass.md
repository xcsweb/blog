Head of the strategic
pass named Tongguan 

潼關吏How busily the soldiers
are building fortifications at the Tongguan Pass！士卒何草草，築城潼關道。The old fortresses
are stronger than those forged in iron； the new ones are
over ten thousand zhang high.





大城鐵不如，小城萬丈餘。I asked head of
the pass, “Are you strengthening your defenses for
the rebels' another attack？”借問潼關吏：“修關還備胡？”He called me to dismount
from my horse for a walk with him when pointing to the lofty mountains. 





要我下馬行，為我指山隅：“Look at those
stockades reaching the clouds, even the birds cannot fly over them.  “連雲列戰格，飛鳥不能踰。When the rebels
come, what my men need to do is guard the fortresses. It's unnecessary to worry about the West Capital
any more！





胡來但自守，豈復憂西都。Mister, you can
see the narrowness of the vital passage only let one war chariot through. 丈人視要處，窄狭容單車。In a critical
situation, a man stationed here can hold out against ten thousand enemy forces.
”





艱難奮長戟，萬古用一夫。”“What a heavy loss
to our army in the Battle of Taolin, and a million soldiers were killed in the
Yellow River！“哀哉桃林戰，百萬化為魚。Please warn your
officers against following Geshu's example. ”





請囑防關將，慎勿學哥舒！”
