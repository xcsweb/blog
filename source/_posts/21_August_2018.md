At the meeting yesterday our principal had told us that an inspection party would first come to our school at about 8:30 today. Under such circumstances, I should go to work early. But unluckily I had to be late for I must stew the carob picked last night before breakfast. I rode my old bike rushing to school without stopping on the whole journey. I arrived at school when the first period was over. The inspectors didn’t come until the third period . 
I accumulated a trike load of the recyclable at school. Tomorrow's weather can permit me carrying them back.
