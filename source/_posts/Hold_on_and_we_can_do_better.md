The reason of hanging in there is we still hold the brief and expect to earn the life we want. Though the path approaches to the goal is not that smooth, everything for that is deserved. In the process of being good is full of difficulties which are the obstacles always prevent us from moving further. Actually, if we move another step forward, we may see the chance right there. The destiny is not made by one action, it is based on the perseverance of every step. Rome is not built in a day. With that strong hope, we can not be easily beaten down.The bitter of failures do pain us, but we can not cave in since everything still goes around, even without a single person, the world remains its orders. If we go ahead, we observe what we meet and feel what we experience. Then we gradually know the misery of life and will be more accountable. The cost of growth is we sacrifice something we love and learn how to judge and choose. We understand better of what we have done. We never act like a kid, on the contrary, we turn to beÂ endurable. In that way, we realize the truth of life struggling relies on both the toleration and the persistence.We are the masters of our own. At the time when we are on top of the mountain we overlook everything behind we have conquered.
