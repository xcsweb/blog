Because of the International Working Women's Day, this afternoon, girls and ladies were allowed to have a half-day leave. Then it was quiet in the office. Though it will still rain on this weekend, it won't be that cold and the mild wind has told the arrival of spring. I quite like this moment since I can view the beauty of nature. By undressing the veil of winter, verdant trees, grass and flowery blossoms happily display their naive and cute appearance.The truth of living in this world is to keep a peaceful mind. Meanwhile experience is the best friend which is with us that we can judge and analyse what is the next step we can move on. This kind of simple principle we hardly remember. We only forget many things that we feel not that important. As a matter of fact, every tiny little story of llife could be a lesson.
