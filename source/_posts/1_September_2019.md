The contemporary poets and calligraphers
lag far behind the ancient sages to catch up with them. 

詩書猶推古聖賢，當世尚須仰頭看。The masterpieces of poetry and calligraphy
handed down to us for thousands of years have won immortal fame. Why don’t you,
poets and calligraphers in name only, feel ashamed to face these magnificent
works?

千年文墨傳芬芳，爾僭何為不汗颜？
