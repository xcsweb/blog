Shangde school has its own unique feature,
which indicates the capability and resolution of its principal. He can make daring decisions on running the school within the scope of authority. He hopes every student can
command a special skill and have some virtue-oriented quality that he or she is
proud of before graduation. He sets a good example for other schools not to
give in to the exam-oriented education.  

Now it is really necessary to establish a
course in calligraphy at primary and secondary schools. But it will be a hard
work to finish for not all students are obedient to their teachers. Not only
students but also teachers lack the enthusiasm and patience to practice
calligraphy. So the first job is to arouse the enthusiasm of the absent-minded students.
