“Only half a
year left,” friends and family advised. Half a year?  How many ten years do we have in a lifetime? How many years
are there within ten years?  And how many
half a year in a year?  And how many months in half a year? Half a year can be critical on some occasions.  The days of  the Three Big Battles during the War of Liberation in late 1940s put together did not last more than half a year.  In retrospet, in half a year my study from almost
scratch of mathematics, physics and chemistry enabled me to be lucky enough for an admission for a university. I also remember the time as a senior when I listened to the broadcast music
lectures for half a year before getting an award for its music knowledge  contest aftermath.   If time is money, then penny foolish, pound unwise.
