Q2: When a teacher's performance is assessed, the ratio of his excellent students should reach a set quota or keep rising year by year. What's your opinion about it?
A: Even Confucius, the greatest master on education, trained only 72 able and virtuous scholars among his three thousand students, in an excellent ratio of 2.4%.
Q3: The parents of some students complain that you teachers have failed them in educating their children.

A: I’m not paid as a superman. They parents can’t discipline their only child whom they may beat and curse at will. How dare they expect a few of us teachers training a whole class of fifty to sixty students to their satisfaction?
