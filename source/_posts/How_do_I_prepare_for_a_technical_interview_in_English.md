How do I prepare
for a technical interview in English?

What’s best method
for such an interview you hope to pass? The first thing to do is finding
several similar interview videos or records I can follow. My interview is for
the Quality Assurance Lead position and what I just did was reading the vivid
interviews from How google tests software.
From this book, I learned the normal questions for interviewing a quality
tester(QE) and quality engineering manager, I recorded some interesting
expressions from interviewees’ answers and tried to use them in introducing my
own experiences, That helps me a lot.

 

When I got the
interview questions and answers, the next thing I did was answering these questions from my own skills, ideas and experiences. For doing this, I didn’t just showed
my experience and knowledge. What’s the most important thing in such an
interview? Show your passion! I took my own examples on explaining why I had passion
on software testing and what my mission was in this area. It is the basis of
following discussion on some concrete skills or methods. Now I am preparing for
these answers.

 

After preparing my
questions, maybe an essential step I will face is oral expression, I will have
to do some practice and record my answers, which definitely helps me speak in
English continuously and fluently, at a good pace.

 

For doing such
preparations, I think it will improve my interview performance rapidly. To be
ware, focusing on a concrete subject, such as software testing, is the key to success,
since if your prepare for general English conversations without definite
subject, you will feel exhausted before you made obvious progress no matter if
or not time allowed.

 

Tomorrow I will
share my answer for one or two questions related to software testing. Bye!
