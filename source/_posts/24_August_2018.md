The weather was not as wild and extreme as predicted. It had been drizzling almost all day long. 
Mother said it was time for top application of chemical fertilizer to the cabbage plot. Yesterday evening I had told her the place where I had left the fertilizer. But earlier this morning when she was to do the topdressing before the rain, she failed to find it for she had forgot my words. Then she began complaining about it ceaselessly in the presence of me. Being annoyed, I went to apply the fertilizer regardless of the drizzling. Mother's dissatisfaction was gone as I returned indoors after finishing the hard muddy work.
