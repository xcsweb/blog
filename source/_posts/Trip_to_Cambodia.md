The last month there was big news that Tigar’s company
was named top one hundred property companies in China, We are all happy to accept
the act and also be out of our imagination a little bit. At the same time, to
be Chairman of the company, Tiger wants to develop his business in overseas at
the long time ago, just by chance; there is a project in Cambodia introduced by
one of friends. So Tiger was going to visit at the last week.

Because of Anita was in there, surely I must be follow
Tiger for see her for the time. The project is in Westport of Cambodia. Even this
was not my first time to go there, I can not believe only two years later, how
big change for a city! The road was so muddy and narrow, I remembered only 200
km away between Phnom Penh to Westport, we drove 5 hours by cars. But right now
40 minutes by air in between. A few houses on the main street but now there are
three five stars hotels and many gamble centres, Chinese logos was everywhere,
so don’t worry if you don’t speak English, what I am trying to say is that it
is very popular many Chinese to invest in Cambodia, due to Westport is really a
beautiful and nature place for travellers, and the good situation of The Belt
and Road,  there are many oil need to
exploited, China has been signed the contract since March of this year. Other reason
Westport will be developed in recent years was this is a deep sea, so the port
can be the international port in some day later, that’s why be to talent and clever
Chinese people might not be missing chance, Surely Tiger to be No 1 of his
company, he has smelled and tasted what the market will be, He is ready to be
one of investors. 

It was a rewarding trip I must say, we learned a lot how
the market like in there, what the people needs in this country, the building is
built only a few weeks, the change of this city I can say month by month,
meaning is after one month later, You will not recognize the place you come
before.
