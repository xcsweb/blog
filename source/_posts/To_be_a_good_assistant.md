As we all know that many of famous guys would
like writing an autobiographic. Tiger is the same he has a wonderful wish that
he would like to have an book talking about himself at the long time ago. Starting
from he joined the army and then, following his career path which he had
changed many kinds of works from state owned company to the international hotel,
and return back to China Netcom, finally he is running his own property company
with his brother till today.

To be honest, I know he is lazy to write
anything on paper or on the computer, so I don’t think he can do it. But some
days before he told me his idea and he found “one girl” can ghostwrite for him
totally, I don’t care who is the girl, I am regard with kindly tolerance as
long as somebody can help him instead of I do, you know it is really big work
on writing. To be his wife I promised him I can be a good assistant to collect
the information to be supporting for the book, including the pictures, the
stories of his life, only I was poor on his works and his company information.

At the last week I was starting to collect digital
photos from my computer and digit out from old album, and then scan it to cell
phone one by one. How can I tell the story and let the write knew? I think my Chinese
is not good enough to write the book, that’s why I prefer to take the record by
voice messages according to each photo, some of stories without picture, talking
about Tiger for me no need to rehearsal of record, each stories I can remember
each clearly, everything in my mind. 

I have collected about 40 pictures, that are meaning it will have at least 40 stories to tell in voice, and then sent the
files by mail to writer, She will according to my story to write her words. It
is not too difficulties for me and I would like to do anything for Tiger.
Hopefully some day later the book can be available to our readers.
