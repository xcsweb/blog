Assigned to take part in a training course on the Integrated Practice at the Teaching and Research Section of Changchun Education Bureau. I had great difficulties to find the place. Soon after signing in there and taking some pictures I left for the Joint Book Mall near the railway station. I happily lingered on there and bought three English dictionaries and several copybooks for practicing calligraphy with the writing brush at a discount for I showed the assistant my book card issued by the mall which I obtained as an award for writing a composition. I was attracted by the miscellaneous assortment of books of the store. Â
