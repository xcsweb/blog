A nostalgic
poem written by Dr Tin 

田博士曾赋诗书道乡关之情Being slow-witted, I've left my
homeland for fifty-odd years. 

家炳不敏 久别乡园 客中岁月 五十余年My native
accent has never changed though my hair has been grey. It was the tombs of my
ancestors that I had been missing most when I was living abroad.

鬓发虽苍 乡音依然 祖宗庐墓 游子心悬On my return,
both the old and the young are beaming with joy. What a great change of my native place!

今日归来 老少开颜 故乡风貌 感慨万千The Chinese
nation has a long history. We should devote ourselves to the charity of our
country. 

中华民族 流长源远 桑梓善业 应尽仔肩I wish all my
fellow-countrymen working
together for the common cause. I'd like to try my best following the virtuous.尚期吾辈 互相策鞭 愿献绵薄 追随群贤
