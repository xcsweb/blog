The report of my fitness suggests that I should have more water and do more exercises, meanwhile I need to keep a heathier diet. Anyway, I do follow it. It is a long way that I should follow.The sedentariness is something most of us can not avoid, especially in the office being with a computer. Everything comes at a price. If you want to lose weight, you have to keep diet and do more exercises. Certain sacrifice has to be made. You can neither eat too much nor enjoy yummy food. Something has to be done.When it comes to life, we really have to be serious. The single journey does not come back again, only can we do is to drive the way positively. Believe it or not, we are aging.To be good to yourself, to be good with people. The responsibility means a lot.
