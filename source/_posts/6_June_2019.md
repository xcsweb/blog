Martyrs to the National Defence 

國殤

Armed with weapons from the Wu state and coats of
rhinoceros skin, the warriors were engaged in a hand-to-hand combat
on the chariots side by side. 

操吴戈兮披犀甲，車錯轂兮短兵接。The flags blocked the sunlight and the enemy
troops were just like masses of clouds. Although showers of arrows came down to
each of the warring sides, the fighters strove to charge at the enemy. 

旌蔽日兮敵若雲，矢交墜兮士争先。Our positions were under attack. The outside
horse on the left drawing the chariot was killed and the external one on the right was knifed. 

凌余陣兮躐余行，左驂殪兮右刃傷。
