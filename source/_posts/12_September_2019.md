At the Mid–autumn Festival, the moon cakes are mostly bought as
gifts presented to others close to the purchasers. Usually coarse food can be seen
on the dining table in an ordinary family.   

中秋糕點貢城闕，平素粗食餐敝廬。

Almost all the presents are a little
unsatisfactory, but they show a good will of the donors and are better than nothing.


禮品向来差人意，但表寸心勝却無。
