As end of each year since 2012, I start thinking my
new book which is for the year 2018, what is the main colour for this year? What
kind of picture of cover can tell my meaningful for this year? The title of
book has to match with other sister books, for example the first letter of all
is “S” started, and also can tell and express what happened in this book, this
and that, I am starting to dick out some ideas from my deep heart.

Base on previous books, white, green, purple, yellow
and blue. The colour of this book I determined that Red to be the main colour. Red
is more high lighting and attractive, it is more splendid like our red flag. Therefore
I was surfing the internet to find the pictures are more fantasy, dreamlike
under the red background, the file of the picture has the specific demanding,
PSD file only can draw the text on the photo, so that’s why it is not easy to
find the right one.

I remembered some friends gave me book their messages
for the wishes on the first page before and I did the foreword for the book as
well, but this book I don’t know yet whether it will be added or not, looking
forward this book of 2018 will be born in the next month.
