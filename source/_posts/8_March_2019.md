Some people of pro-city may say they can benefit
from the excellent medical care and education there which fall short of
standard in rural areas. But they haven’t realized that when they enjoy the
privileges they have become the victims of different diseases for the harmful
environments and unhealthy way of life and they and their kids have been and
will be trained as test-machines in the test-orientated factories rather than schools for moral education has almost
been neglected. They think it successful to obtain admission to some prestigious
school and get a well-paid job. People are seeking more than necessary which easily leads
to wrongdoings.
