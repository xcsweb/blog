It took me about two hours to push back the trike load of the recyclable step by step. 
Had to conduct five periods today. In fact, I couldn’t give any lessons to the students because either no textbooks are available or the class advisers had assigned work for the pupils. So my task is to keep order in the classes. The students needn’t take examinations in the subjects I teach. They are Comprehensive Practice, Information, Nationality and Training for Success. Putting out these books causes a large waste of materials and labor every year. This phenomenon should be eradicated as soon as possible.
