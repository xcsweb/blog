This National Day holiday is timed for the first seven days of October. It is the busiest holiday the whole year round. We usually clear the ash from the flue of our kang on this occasion. The annual work is strenuous and dirty. But it is worthy to do that. Every day we cook by the economical and convenient stove connected with the kang, which can do much good to our health. It is especially tempting in the cold weather before the supply of the central heating in the apartment buildings. That is why both mother and I prefer the bungalow to the flat and hate to sell it.
