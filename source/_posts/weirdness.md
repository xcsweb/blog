    I, on bed, with closed eye in stark contrast with extreme detective hearing, failed to adjust the pose into asleep. I hearing crickets singing, car`s wheels rolling over the road, objective existings with a piece of bemusement.    I depressed, a black hole lurking in my brain, have not been filled with, yes, the new knowledge. I do not know whether it stems from an kind of society anxiety or just as simply as an used habit.    The absorbed new knowledge daytime, sucked my energy, dismayed my confidence and at last with the end of the day triggering the brain to rest.    Once i tried to study before sleeping, but it`s not in my favor, following bizarre dreams not fit my appetite.    I am surrounded by new knowledge, priorize them and every time dig deeper more compound i find, so i have come to peace. The tip of the iceberg, one water of the sea, what you explored only witness where once your were and the changings, overwhelmingly push you here and there without your proactive. We are just a negligible sand in the era, be yourself is never a easy thing to prove.    Good morning, and fill my soul seems plausible right daytime.
