I’ve got even more messages recently that is sleeping is a problem . Then I tried to discuss about the issue with friends . Apparently speaking , some of the opinions are reasonable enough to prove my suspicion : the one who thought sleeping is wasting on time originally , However, as time past , they found the fact that sleepless time had destroyed their health , there are always something uncomfortable influence the normal work day . Not until this situation appeared , did they realize sleeping is the trouble for them .It is hard to tell whether it is worth sacrificing the health on working , perhaps the extra return can counteract the worry . I admire the view that do not pursue much more than you can bear , because the much more you should pay the price.
