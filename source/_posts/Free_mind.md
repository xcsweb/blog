It is not a thing you can not do, it is the way you have not tried before. Yesterday, it was hisotry, now it is the right time to do something. Why do you have to worry too much about the future? Things would be fine if you are preared well in confidence. That confidence is not built on the saying of I CAN DO, instead, on the practice of constant training. Though it may happen somehting unexpectable, it never becomes the excuse of retreat.Â Free yourself up.
