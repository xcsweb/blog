Time never lies, while it is so hard to wait. We have fun and feel not enough, we suffer hard times and feel so fragile. No one has right to disturb others life, I need some distractiom, and I saw the day I die. As you can see, I am standing in the point of a half life of a man, we ask less while searching more of spirit, if there is no order or chaos, I can say, therefore God exist. But one thing is for sure, I am more of nearning death.
