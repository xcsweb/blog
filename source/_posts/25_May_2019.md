The descendant of the hare's eighth
generation inhabited at Zhongshan during the Yin dynasty. Having mastered the
witchcraft of the god, it could make itself invisible and have things done as
it pleased. It rode the three-legged toad to the moon and had a
secret love affair with the goddess there. Then its posterity retired from
society and never took up any official post. 

朙眎八世孫䨲，世傳當殷時居中山，得神仙之術，能匿光使物，竊姮娥、騎蟾蜍入月，其後代遂隱不仕云。
