The downpour last night had not been
predicted by the forecast earlier. How numerous the things are beyond our
expectations！

未報將雨雨滂沱，世事難料何其多！It's as cool as in the autumn this morning. Who can
bear the chill outside in a T-shirt？

今朝凉意恍若秋，户外汗衫誰堪受？The strong wind carried the mosquitoes away
last night. Hence I could sleep without being molested.

昨夕蚊遁風驟，一夜安眠無憂。
