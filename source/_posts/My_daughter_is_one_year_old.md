     My daughter just passed her first birthday last week. she became a lovely little girl from a newborn.     She can walking quickly with the help of adults or hold a table.      she has 4 tooth which make her like a rabbit when smiling.      She's smile are so lovely and let you forget all the annoyance.      She love to learn all the actions of adults and repeat them again and again.      She knows the carrot is delicious than the rice flour and don't want to eat that anymore.      She knows there are some decious food in the refrigerator and always want to find them out.       She will depressed and cry when mother hug other kids which even her brother.       She will laughed loudly when I life her up and down.       I always surprised by how clever of her although she just 1 year's old.       My wife always laugh with her although it is a tired thing to take care her.       It's a hard and happy life to grow up kids. Kids are the best gifts for us. Hope they are happy and grow up healthy in the future.
