Now that son has left, yesterday we began preparing for removing the ashes and soot out of the flues of the kang today. First I moved the quilts and clothes to the west room from the cabinet in the east room. Mother feared we would be burgled at night without her presence in the west room. So she decided to sleep there guarding against dangers in spite of my opposition and persuasion. I worried for her because both the room and the kang within were cool and she might catch cold. She has been getting used to warmth of the east room heated every day by the cooking stove. The effort to heat the west kang failed yesterday evening with a lot of smoke left in the room.
