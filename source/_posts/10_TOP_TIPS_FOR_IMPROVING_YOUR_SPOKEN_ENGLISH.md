1.Speak,
speak, speak!

Be confident and speak as often as possible to as many people as you
possibly can! Do not be shy to make mistakes! The more you practice the better
and more confident you will become in your pronunciation and vocabulary.
Remember, speaking is a skill like learning a musical instrument or new sport –
the only way you can get good is to actually do it!

2.Use
technology

A smartphone can be a powerful tool for learning languages. Use it to
record yourself speaking then listen back to see how your English sounds to
other people. Make the most of all your favourite productivity apps to organise
your practice time and make a note of all the new words you learn.

3.Listen

Listen to news bulletins and songs in English to listen to the
pronunciation of words. You can also learn new words and expressions this way.
The more you listen, the more you learn! Try copying what you hear to practise
your pronunciation and learn which words in a sentence are stressed.

4.Read
out loud

Read the newspaper or a magazine out to yourself. You could even find a
script for your favourite TV show and act it out! This is a great way to
practise pronunciation because your only need to concentrate on making sure you
English sounds great and don’t need to worry about sentence structure or
grammar.

5.Learn
a new word every day

Choose a word you would like to work on and use practice it in different
sentences. Use the word until you have learnt it and keep using it regularly.

6.Watch
films

Watch movies in English and pay attention to new vocabulary and
pronunciation. Imitate the actors and have fun with it.

7.Make
friends

Make friends with English speakers or others learning to speak English
and compare notes. Talk about things that you have learnt and exchange ideas

8.Do
interesting activities in English

Take a cooking course in English or join a book club! Anything you enjoy
doing, make sure you do it and communicate it in English. Using English to talk
about things you enjoy will make practising a positive experience.

9.Have
a debate

Debate all the topics that interest you with friends in English. Try to
use as much vocabulary as you can to get your point across and listen to the
other arguments carefully so you can argue against them effectively.

10.Use
a dictionary

Online dictionaries often have audio examples so you can check your
pronunciation and there are lots of great dictionary apps that you can take
everywhere with you on your smartphone. Make sure not to become too reliant on
these tools, though. Have a go at saying the words first then check afterwards
to see if you were right!
