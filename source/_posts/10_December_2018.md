Liu Yuling is the foremost living performing artist of Pekinese-styled Hebei opera. She took in the strengths of all her teachers and other accomplished performers and developed a style all her own.
She was an enthusiastic theatrical performer in her childhood although no one in her family had any connection with acting. Thanks to her outstanding art gift and quick-wittedness, she was admitted to a troupe starting her apprenticeship as a Pekinese-styled Hebei opera performer at the age of eleven.
Liu is a versatile artist, who can sing Peking Opera and Hebei Opera, perform new operas and a soloist of folk songs. In order to improve singing, she has ever learned vocal music from some vocalists. Many honors and awards have heaped upon her for her prominent performing achievements.
