Many literary classics contain the narration
of adultery. It’s the reflection of the reality and the people’s desire at the time. We have
no hatred for the characters on account of their immoral behavior. The adulterous
affair described might be of interest to the readers. Sometimes we cannot hide
our envy of the heroes and heroines who are brave enough to ignore any morals. Usually
they are not condemned by the authors. On the contrary, they are presented as
models of pursuing individuality liberation. It was said Tolstoy could not help
sobbing when he wrote down the paragraphs concerned with Anna’s death.
