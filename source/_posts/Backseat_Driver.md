So I'd like you to imagine for a moment, that you are a runner in the heat of a running contest, maybe you have already run for quite a time, your adrenaline is elevated, and you are tired and tensed up because other runners keep cutting in and running ahead of you. And then there is a man coming out of nowhere, shouting and showering you with suggestions and orders: "Deep breath. Deep breath. How can you forget about deep breath? Run faster, another one is going to catch up! Watch your step! Can't you see there is a stone on the road?" How would you feel about it? Would you feel appreciate about his suggestion, or his words, even probably they are right, would simply release some wild violence that is suppose to safely lock in your genes, and for a moment you want so much to knock him out with any brick you can reach? Some help is toxic, like a help from a back seat driver. I never realized that my husband could be so annoying. When he drove, I was glad to curl up in the passenger seat, taking a napping or enjoying the beauty out of the window. Since he got ill, I had to drive. And the nightmare started. Okay, I admit that I am not a good driver, but thanks to him, I become from bad to the worse. Yesterday, I was so irritated about his nagging, I didn't notice that I crossed the solid line when changed the lane. For the first time, the police stopped me and gave me a ticket. Someone said, for man, driving is about control, it represents the power. Okay, I donï¿½t understand this logic of a man, and take whatever the power in it and just leave me with the peace.
