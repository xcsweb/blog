     People might think that big things should be done to save the earth. Many forget that saving the earth begins with small things. For example, we can save electricity by turning off the lights when we leave a room. We can also use reusable bags instead of plastic bags. I think it's a good idea that we now have to pay for plastic bags in some stores. And instead of driving to school or work, we can ride our bike or walk. If it's far, we could take the bus. In this way can we lead a low-carbon life. All these small things can add up and become big things that would improve the environment. Let's take action now.
