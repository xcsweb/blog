It’s unnecessary to explain the rules and
techniques of writing in particular. It’s enough to expound them briefly. The
teachers may show the students how to write the main strokes. Then let them
repeatedly practice the dot, the horizontal, the vertical, the left-falling
stroke, the right-falling stroke, the turning stroke, the hook stroke. First,
the pupils can retouch the red printed characters with a writing brush in black
or trace over them with a piece of transparent paper covered. Then try to copy
the calligraphy works put in front. Both teachers and students must avoid
eagerness for quick results. Practice outside class should be encouraged if one
really wants to be skilled in handwriting.
