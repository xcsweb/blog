This weekend is sunny. Finally, the sun comes out. While the bad news is it will rain again the day after tomorrow and it will not end till in the next early month. So I went out this evening to run around. I have not done outdoors workout for more than two weeks as of the Spring Festival. And I do not want to wast this chance before the arrival of rain. On the way, the dusty air caused by the site of subway construction. I did not care about that and ran all the way. The reason I run is I enjoy the joviality when I breathe. After sweating, then I took a bath, I was to be refreshed and energetic. Another week is coming. Good night.
