The rainy weather continues. The prolonged
drought comes to an end temporarily. The temperature drops sharply with the
help of chilly wind. On my way to school, I saw large grey clouds were so low
across the vault of heaven. The new thickening poplar leaves were rustling in
the wind. In such weather, people put on the thick clothes just taken off to
keep warm. The sprouts in the open are shivering with cold and their growth
comes to a standstill. But the greens in the greenhouses are an exception. It was
forecast that the temperature will rise to 30 degrees the coming Friday.Â
