The predicted rain didn’t come and the sky was only overcast sometimes. 
Our headmaster had his deputy tell me to come to work in time because I'm always late. I decided never to stay too long at the bungalow after supper from today. I should return to the apartment as early as possible. Go to sleep after finishing my diary. This perhaps ensures my earlier rising next morning. I must try my best not to be late again. I should get ready to start out at half past six am. Not to stop on my way for picking bottles in sight.
