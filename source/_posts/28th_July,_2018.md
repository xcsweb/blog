It seems that no one doubts the most important thing in life is to keep alive. But in reality most people donâ€™t prize their life, especially the young. They assume that the fatal diseases have nothing to do with them. They overwork for realizing their dreams of being someone. They stay up late or all night entertaining themselves. Some take regular exercise in an attempt to keep fit. But in the meantime they live anxiously in the pressure of competing modern life. The tension and stress almost counteracts the function of the exercise. Their immunity to diseases weakens as time passes. They may fall ill at any time.
