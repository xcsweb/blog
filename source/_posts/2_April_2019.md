Today I'd like to acquaint you with
a dish my family often enjoys recently, which is called Streaky Pork Steamed
with Tofu and Poached Eggs. 

今儿给大家分享一款我家最近常吃的菜肴【五花肉豆腐蒸荷包蛋】，

The cooking method of this dish is very simple.
Its main materials include bean curd, marbled meat and eggs. 

这个菜做法十分简单，主要用到的食材有：豆腐、五花肉、鸡蛋。

These are very common food materials rich in
protein. 

这些食材都是很常见的，也是蛋白质含量很丰富的食材，

After cooking them together in a steamer, you'll find this cuisine
tender, smooth, delicious with some exudates in addition.  Mixing it with rice must satisfy your appetite.
  

把这几样食材放在一起下锅蒸，不仅嫩滑鲜香，还有汤汁渗出，拌饭吃特别棒。
