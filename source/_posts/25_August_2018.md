The price of the eggs has gone up recently with the close of the hot weather. I could buy only 16 eggs at Â¥10. 
The other day I saw many winged insects in the middle room where our corn was stored. The prolonged storage had begot the appearance of worms. After breakfast mother began to remove the impurities from the corn with a winnowing fan. Soon I carried two half-filled bags of cleaned corn with a wheelbarrow to the mill east of town. Today was a trading day. But when I passed the market it had been almost deserted. The matron serving me at the mill said the vendors were reluctant to come for the taxes levied on them.
