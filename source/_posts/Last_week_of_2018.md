     This week is last week of the 2018 and the New Year is
on the way, as usual, we will do summary and sum up all we did in life and work
during the past year. No doubt, there was always something we did that is not
satisfied even by myself, because I do not insist on keeping on going so that
it did not reach what I expected at the beginning of this year, anyway, I still
need to keep forward no matter how far is the target. Now, what I need do is to
set up a feasible and reasonable target that I realize with a little difficulty.
I understand the target setting is easy and the hard thing is to follow up your
target continuously. I think I at least have ten years golden time in my career
if there is no big economic crisis within this period. Of course, this is based
on current assumptions. Nowadays, I still think I have room to improve myself
and get a higher lever in company, but, I have to admit that I am not an
ambitious guy in company even I have the feeling of disgust to these guys who take
every opportunity to show off in front of big boss. Absolutely, it will leave a
positive impression to big boss, but, I also believe the real status depends on
what you contribute to company.    Anyway,
everyone has their principles of survival in company. I just follow up my
principle and keep my bottom line to everything which happen around me and always
to keep calm to handle conflicts during daily work.
