It was rainy and overcast all day long and
the expected moon didn’t appear until later in the evening in a vague image. The
bad weather resulted in the sparseness of pedestrians on the street. 

雲雨遲遲見昏月，巷衢眇眇逢散人。What a pity the shopkeepers had cudgeled
their brains! In such weather, to their dismay, their prospective clients would
rather stay at home than go shopping.

可憐商家用心苦。無奈顧客居意深。
