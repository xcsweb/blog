My daughter told me at the two weeks ago that there
was a game of balance bike for baby, she has nominated for Xiao Bao. The event
would be hold at SKP Beijing where is her company, and this is the final
competition after select 300 participants, due to her relationship our baby
would not take the first round, direct into the final game. Thatâ€™s why she wanted
us to cheer for our baby at the day.

Balance bike is kind of bike without step plate and it
is only for baby, right not it very popular, you can see it everywhere in
playground. As we were told there were many qualification babies who have taken
the professional class only for this kind of bike to join the event of the day.
So this match must be a splendid party, let our baby to take more chances to
see and open his eye instead of only staying at home before go to kindergarten.

There were four groups by age, for 2-3 years old group
is the first group would be starting at 9.30am at Yesterday, one by one is
going at set the circuit with four kind of obstacle blocks, the baby has to go through
without any helps, the faster is to be winner. Xiao Bao likes the bike so much,
this is one of his favourite toys, as long as any outings he prefers to ride
it, and the bike is safer then walking or running for 2 and half years old baby,
maybe he asked for hug shamelessly if everyone is around him. So any obstacle on
the way he has can do it well and easily, I do believe Xiao Bao can be complete
the match for sure.

There are about 20 babies and their parents have been
checked in at the counter, Ours is Number 2, lucky number, the sticker of number
should be sticking on each bike before register, seems everything is
professional, the scene is very living and vivid with disco music, due to some
sunshine boys was playing street dance and hip-hop to encourage babies has good
performance.

I was ready to be the photo photographer at the site
to record the great moment during him perform, after the host said to start,
Xiao Bao was so handsome with his helmet go out from starting point sharply, I
did not see any afraid from his face, each of blocks on the way he did very
freely, seemed that he understood he must be hard work, he was really not a baby,
he was a big boy, I was so exciting to move my camera and following his figure
slowly to record, after he crossed the final line smoothly, the cheer up and
the round applause by audience for him was so loud and exciting.

The result is not so important thing for them. In fact,
what you have got from the game that you took part in is most important than, I
do believe he and my daughter learned a lots from it, I hope more and more
babies and their family would think about it, trying to take more chances like
this. Every baby to participate has the medal after event, which is the first
medal for him in his life; hopefully he will get more medals in the future.
