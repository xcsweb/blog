The emperor hopes
his officials to be grateful and manage to save the state and its subjects
after receiving the awards of baskets of silk. If they ignored the intention
and failed to fulfill their duties, His Majesty would have rewarded in vain.   

聖人筐篚恩，實欲邦國活。

臣如忽至理，君豈棄此物。The benevolent
among the numerous courtiers should carry out their obligations with reverence
and awe. Moreover, it is said that all the gold vessels in the imperial palace
have been removed to the mansion of the prime minister. 多士盈朝廷，仁者宜戰栗。



况聞内金盤，盡在衞霍室。
