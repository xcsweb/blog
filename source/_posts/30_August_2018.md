I had watched some fragments of Theresa May's speaking on TV news. She impressed me well. And I was fascinated by her gracefulness and voice. From yesterday I began searching for her speeches and appreciating them on the Internet. 
The rainy weather recently made it hard for me to close the window and the house door. 
After oiling the key and the lock of the room I stay at school, then I can easily open and lock it now. Ms F, the class adviser of Grade Four, offered to give lessons at the periods I should have conducted classes within.
