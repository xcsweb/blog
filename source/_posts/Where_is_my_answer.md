      I have too many confuse these days.  And even doubt my experience and values in the past ten years.  Am I wrong?  If I choose the wrong way?  What should I do in the future? I was depressed for that. I want to get an answer in a long time by self-reflection and getting advice from the other people.       My friends give me some advice and comfort. But no one can provide my answer, I have to find it by myself. I need to self-reflect and modify my plan but don't need to deny the past.  There are so many difficult to get a step forward but I will get a better future finally.      I'll get my answer soon.
