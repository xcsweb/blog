A shower was suddenly heard when it was
sunny outside. A black cloud was just hanging overhead. 

驕陽西照起雨聲，一片烏雲正當空。Some bundles of corn stems and washed
clothes were being left to dry in the yard. I rushed out to remove them quickly
from the raindrops. 

薪柴衣物曝於庭，東奔西突现救兵。It's really against the teachers' professional ethics
to seek temporary gain at the expense of principle. 

謀利弄機巧，固背吾師道。Now my colleagues should have adopted
unfair means openly for the attainment of selfish aims and purposes. No wonder public
morals are declining day by day.  今則乃公然，世風亦可料。
