Yesterday seeing the weather sunny and the workers gone after finishing the reconstruction of the enclosing wall next to which the heap of my corn stalks is located, I decided to tear it open drying the stems in the sun. And I cancelled my noon break continuing the hard work. Later I felt very tired. Today I rode brother's trike to school for transporting the dry stalks back. On my arrival one of the wheels fell out of its place unexpectedly. With the help of Mr S and Mr W, it got in place again. S tightened the loose big nuts with the large spanner borrowed by W. Â
