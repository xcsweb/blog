    This week I continued to work overtime except Wednesday. The trend will last to next Wednesday until the expert from American plant comes back. During the past several day, it is really tough time for me, I can't have a good rest under big pressure and tons of workload. To make my cray is that my boss wants to assign more to me, of course, I immediately refuse his unreasonable demands. This time our conservation is different before.I didn't lose my temper, neither did he. Maybe we are known each other that can find a proper way to discuss or argue one case. The final result of conversation is to escalate to his boss to make the further decision. As return, I told him that I never accept any extra work no matter who wants to discuss with me in privacy.    rom my side, I think if I can well handle current job without mistake is a challenge. I don't want to sacrifice my free time too much focused on working, I would like to get a good balance between work and leisure. Maybe, my opinion is not accepted by someone else, but I think I should stick to my ideas and follow up my heart. Anyway, pull myself together and go to bed early today, to meet another busy day tomorrow.
