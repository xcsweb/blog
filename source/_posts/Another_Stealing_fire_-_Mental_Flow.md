 I learned
about the conception of Mental Flow from a TV program of introducing new books.
This time, the TV presenter interpreted a new book called “Stealing fire”. The story of “Stealing
fire” is originated from ancient Greek mythology concerning Prometheus. He stole
the fire from Olympus and brought it back to earth. But I understood that the
main point of this book is to introduce the conception of mental flow and present
how it functions magically in American military special operators. The author likened
mental flow to another fire stolen from Olympus.

Even though I
haven’t read this book myself, I try to explain mental flow by my own
understanding from TV show. I remembered that the biological teacher told us the
most of the human brain to everyone has not been developed. The human brain is composed
by thousands billion cells, and their functions are still mysterious for us. However,
we realized our human consciousness is mostly produced by our brain, as complex
as the structure of the brain, and it is usually difficult to be stopped and
controlled. The so-called mental flow is a mental status, in which the brain
only focuses on what someone is working on with no other distraction, and in
which the one could also enjoy or be immersed in a satisfying feeling and the
time is neglected. In simple words, we turn off all the others of our brain
except one part to focus on what is going on, that is the status of mental
flow. The status can optimize the organization of the special operators and
shorten efficiently their learning time. To master a new foreign language could
nearly take six weeks for them.

Based on my
experiences, mediation is a practical manner to access to the status. The status
could help me to have an efficient rest for ten minutes and to drive away
negative emotions shortly.
