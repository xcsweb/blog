Absolutely, this week and the next week will be a very
busy period even I have to sacrifice my whole weekend involving the new
production line setup, what’s more, the most difficulty thing is the very tight
schedule. That’s mean, we don’t have enough time to do calibration, because we must
meet the customer demand of shipping out product before the weekend. So huge
pressure in front of us, I can’t imagine how to complete it. According to
contract, to finish all machine setup should be twenty-four days, actually, it
will be shortened to one week. There are lots of factors caused the delivery time
behind of schedule and they also have some unpredictable factors waiting for us.
Anyway, it’s a big challenge for me to handle this kind of project. I just hope
everything can keep in order. 

For this project, there are three so called expert
already on site for supporting in order to run the process smooth. I admit they
can help us in theories, but, I don’t think they can help us doing detailed
tasks such as program create or debut even the basic machine setup. But,
anyway, even they are invited to come here, they must have their strongpoint in
somewhere. As plan, they will be stayed here for at least two week, I don’t think
I have too much time accompany with them, because there are always tasks
waiting me or our team to handle……
