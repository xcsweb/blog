Life is full of boredom. So during or after
the boring work, people tend to amuse themselves in different ways. They jest
about something, play games, watch TV or computer, make trips etc. Under such
circumstances, story-telling and story-writing come into being. The dictionary defines story as account of
invented or imagined events, untrue statement and lie except other meanings. We
are told not to lie and we also warn our children against cheating. But in the
meantime, we all like reading story-books and encourage our children to do so. We have
been enjoying interesting stories made up since childhood, how can we guarantee
against the occurrence of deceiving.Â
