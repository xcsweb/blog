     I was tired of writting after many years writting training in the middle school.  So I love to record things and beautiful views by a camera instead writting for many years.  But now, photos can't exciting me as before after 3 cameras are retired.      Now, I love to draw somethings on my sketch book although it need a lot of time and I'm not good at it.  I can find the speciall beauty from a drawing rather than photo.  I begin to understand why the photo can't replace the drawing and others arts.  It may be sample, colourless, disproportinate or abstract, but all that can't cover the beauty of a drawing.  And we can feel it better when we drawing it by us.  I always see things by line and colour rather than a object.  I want to draw it down when I see some beautiful  building or view.     Most of my friends think it's amazing for a staightforward northern man to sit down and have a drawing. But I love drawing and enjoy myself by that.
