In the chilly weather, it feels warmer in the flat than in the bungalow when both without heating. The flat is not only flanked by other apartments but there are rooms above and under it to keep the cold out. But the bungalow is solitary and detached from other houses. The warmth within can easily dissipate. Therefore people prefer the flat to the bungalow in winter. Moreover, living in the flat can keep people from dampness in the wet season. However, in the hot summer the bungalow is cooler than the flat. And in the days before and after the heating period, the bungalow with a warm kang is tempting to the flat dwellers.
