             One should  have enormous power if you set a goal and persist it , no matter what happened to you , However, few people can indulge in it , and ignor what happened around him . so I don't  want to be the few one .Now I promise publicly the goal to all of you that I want to come into the university again to gain the Master diploma, for which I plan to spend 2 years .           The disadvantage hinder the aim is I have not enough time . It is impossible to quit job , meanwhile , I can't sacrifice the previlege of taking care my daughters . But I know that nothing is imporssible .From now on I have to cut off all I can to save time . what's more , I spare any effort and make all the time efficently in spending . if all I have done is valid , then  the master diploma will belong to me in 2 years .          Do hope some friends will remind me  focusing on my goal in the next  months .
