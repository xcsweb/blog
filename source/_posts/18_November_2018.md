It is usually thought the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is just as incompatible as fire and water. Both sides often criticize each other face to face or privately. Therefore most daughters-in-law have determined to live apart from their mothers-in-law even before their wedding. Some single men can hardly find wives when they insist on living with their parents after marriage. As long as the parents keep healthy and can take care of themselves, they may live separately from their married children temporarily. But the children had better live as close to their parents as possible and make frequent visits to them in case the seniors need help.
