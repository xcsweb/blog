I visited the relatives with Tiger for a few days in
Zhan Jiang, everyday eating was the main points from the morning to the late
evening, entertain us as the guests, Actually I don’t like the life like this so
much, to be respect I had to show my artificial smile to others. In fact my
heart had been flying to Hai Nan of my friends. 

Jiang Li my good friend, she bought the house in Lin Shui
of Hai Nan province, five of us were invited by her and her husband kindly in this
cold winter for two weeks, luckily I was in Zhan Jiang, it was not too far to
be there, so I can fly to her directly after my own business.

Lin Shui is a famous place to invest house for North
part people, due to there is a beautiful seaside and not too many people yet,
it is the county, to be there I have to go by train. Social network has had a
very positive effect in our life, the tickets by air and by train were all
settled in the smart phone just one bottom in advance. LiLi and her husband
picked me up in the station on time, I was so moved when I saw her, I felt
finally I found out our team.

Four of them have come to Lili place one week ago; I
did not how they lived and how to have the meal together, I thought they may
rent an apartment in the same community, even I knew LiLi is a so kind and
honest to her friends always, to my surprised, all of them were eating together
at her home and living their friend’s apartment by free. Due to the new house
did not open water yet, all of them took the shower in LiLi’s home one by one and
day by day, How come? The hotel nearby is very convenient including the
breakfast, the room rental is reasonable I checked, why don’t they live outside
instead of bothering the trouble to LiLi, If I were LiLi I cannot accept it
even my relatives. So the first day I came, I had very rude suggest to every
one of the friends. Should we move out to the hotel for the following days? No problem
I can pay the room of hotel. 

LiLi for sure did not agree my idea and insisted leave
it like this politely. Even other people agreed my action wanted to pay
afterward by 1000 each for the compensation, I had to accept and starting our
group living for following days.
