My sanitation work came to an end abruptly. This morning on my arrival at school Mr W greeted me as if to assign some new task to me like cleaning somewhere or some other trivial chores. To my surprise I was informed to restore my former duty－teaching. I needn’t do the disgraceful job any more. I haven’t entreated principal to show some mercy. Maybe he has realized the unreasonable assignment of my job. My teaching work has been shared by the class advisers since the eve of the Teachers' Day. They must have been displeased with this decision.
