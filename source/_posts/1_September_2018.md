Today is the twenty-second of the seventh month by the lunar calendar, the Birthday of the God of Wealth. Early in the morning, I first heard some explosions of firecrackers not far off. I had mistaken them for the signal of the beginning of a funeral. Soon I realized my misjudgment when more and more crackers exploded with bangs here and there. Then I guessed people must be celebrating the Birthday of the God of Wealth. By the evening the celebration reached high tide. I not only heard the deafening noise but saw the fireworks being set off in the street and smelt the dynamite.
