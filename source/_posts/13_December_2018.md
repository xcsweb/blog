A decision made by the Propaganda Department of CPC Central Committee to confer on Z the title of a Model of the Times 
Comrade Zhang Yugun is headmaster of Black Tiger Temple Primary School, High Mound Township, Zhenping County, Henan Province. 
Without forgetting his original intentions and willingly giving up the chance to work in the cities, he has been firmly embedded in the deep mountains and struggling persistently in the front line of teaching for seventeen years in the countryside. For lack of teachers, he has devoted himself to the job whole-heartedly, studying every subject intensively and practicing teaching hard for giving each class satisfactorily. 
Regardless of any sacrifice to himself, he learnt sewing and cooking for serving the increasing boarders; he helped the poor students generously with money; with no transport service in the mountain area, he had to carry back textbooks and stationery by a shoulder pole for the students; his resolute dedication to grass-roots education has brought new hope to the local children pursuing their studies.
