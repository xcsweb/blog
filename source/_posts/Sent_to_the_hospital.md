At the last few weeks, we were at Pan Shan home
in weekend as usual, Tiger with his nephew were at home studying English, I
went to the property office for my toy. When I was backing home, Tiger told me
his heart rate was so fast, and he had taken saving pills. I can see he looked
so uncomfortable from his face; I picked him to the sofa and let him lying down
immediately.

Everybody around Tiger knew that he has the
heart disease for some years, at the two years ago he had had heart operation
which was taken three hours, it was called Fang Shan in medical, even we
invited the famous doctor did the operation for him, we were so happy to know
it was perfect operation, after the time the heart attack came around once, we
did not go to hospital, just let him sitting down for a while, he was becoming normal.

But this time the data was showing 180 t in 15 minutes,
I was a little shuck and asked him to the hospital at once. You know Ji Xian is
only a small county in Tian Jian, There is a hospital far to our home around 20
km away. The time was limit for a heart attack person. I forced him into the car
to the hospital immediately.

I must say Tiger was so coolness facing the troubles;
he was opening GPS for the direction and called his friends for the helps on
the car, even there were many rate limited on the traffic, it was taken 20
minute more on the way, the speed of rate heart was still fast, I was so worry
about Tiger, I can see T-Shirt of Tiger was totally wet, I had to make sure
everything safe for my driving I told myself.

Luckily his friends had been waiting him at the
hospital in advance; I should thank so much to his friends here. Few of them
carried him to the emergence room directly. People says that good people
believes in pay backs. Yes it was, the doctor was a so experience woman, she
was calm down and let him injection a shot, his heart was becoming smoothly. How
dangerous he was? I understood peopleâ€™s life was just in one second, if you did
not know how serious for the heart attack person, you might not see him today.
Luckily we went to the hospital instead of staying at him, luckily his friends were
so reliable, Luckily the doctor was so cool for a shot, Luckily Tiger was so
smart and strong when we were on the way. Back to think about those, I was so
fear after the horrible disaster.
