Tomorrow is the Beginning of Autumn. It marks the end of the heatwave and the start of the cool weather. It's time to put the fan away. 
I'll go to the cemetery in Changchun visiting my late wife whose cinerary casket is deposited there. This time I am to pay for leaving the casket at the place for the coming three years. The last lease expires this month. For the past eight years I have gone there with son towards the anniversary of her death annually. Tomorrow I'll go alone for son had turned down my proposal to get there before his departure for school.
