Helicopter parenting describes a style of
raising children where parents were over protective and do too much. It
describes parents hover over their kids at home and at the playground like a helicopter.
Today modern technology allows these helicopter parents to hover from even far
away. They can give their children direction at any moment from anywhere. 

Many authors have written books about how to
raise an adult: break free of over parenting trap and prepare your kids to
success, and how to see the checking list the students in the school, are they
are really good students with high score in the class? Why helicopter parents
is bad for your teen’s health.

Recently I am watching TV “A Little Reunion”,
it is talking about three families with high school students who will be going
to university entrance examination, One of family they are helicopter parents,
they force the kids study hard and study after the class, putting the end of
their interests, let the little hearts of them are less of hope for their
future, no communication with parents. Right now I am not talking about our government
education way is good or not, in most of parent’s eyes, the entrance
examination is the only way for the young students to open their career bridge,
that’s why they have to do many things are going beyond the limit to the kids. As
we all know that some of western countries have entertainment education, no
much home works for students, the parents are focus on their interests to train
as their friends.

I am so proud of my daughter she is smart and
very intelligent, during her school time, Tiger and I did not give her any
pressure for study, for sure I am not a helicopter parents and I believe she
had the happy and relax childhood till she became a post graduate student.
