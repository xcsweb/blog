Absolutely, the second of the three ten-day
period of hot season, these days everywhere including Beijing is really hot
like sauna day. After back from Lu Shan mountain where is mountain resort and
be away of summer heat. I have to adapt it for the coming weeks.

I have gotten right way to the fitness in every
morning, yesterday was Wednesday it was my swimming day, after back home from
the club, during the breakfast, I cannot believe that the sweat rolled down my
whole body, making my skirt totally wet just in an hour. I changed other shirt quickly.
I did not check the data of temperature of the date officially, but I guess at
least 38-40 degree indoor, you know I seldom turn on the air conditioner in the
morning, but this time I did no doubt.

This morning for sure I got up early and
following my step to the fitness on time. I am always the first one to be
there, like every time I opened the windows nearly my running machine, turn on
my favorite movie on my pad, I am the regular doing exercise, so I know how to
control rate of heart and my speed of running, running is not so hard for me in
an hour. 

After 20 minutes on the treadmill, I cannot
image the sweat from my body drop to the machine and the ground, Ah, is this me?
I checked my elbows, yes, it was making by my water arms, even my whole body
has been wet, but I did not feel so tired and my rate of heart was still in
peaceful, and the step of speed was not so slow, everything was under my
control, that’s why I kept on going till to my bottom line, 5 kilometers every
time within 35 minutes. 

Have you seen my sweats on my shoulders? Please
see it enlarge of picture.
