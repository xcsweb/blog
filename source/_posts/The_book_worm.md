Since Magic book store was closed, we regret trying to
find other place has the same sense and feeling. Just by occasionally we were told
by BUBU’s mother, The Book Worm where is not too far from the home, somewhere
in San Li Tun area. This is the book store with some drinks; the books are all English
original books, some for adult, some for kids as well. There are a few tables
and simple wooden chairs with traditional cotton pattern table cloth, the light
is not too strong, a little dark, You can read there for whole day quietly, why
I like there, not only for the books, but also I like the sense and the atmosphere.

San Li Tun area is more modern and famous place in
Beijing, there are many embassies and bars located, that’s why many of foreigners
from different countries come in this book store. There is one teacher from
Kenya who is leading the class for baby in the store at every Friday morning. I
took our baby and BuBu to the class at the last week; you paid to the Chinese coffee
girl by wechat each time before the class.

The teacher prepared many toys and Chinese songs and
English songs for kids, most of the kids are 0+-2 years old only, the class is
about one hour more, many of young mothers is holding the baby to the class on
time, some are the wives of the ambassador and senior executive. I can say western
education is to pay attention to the interaction between mother and baby, I was
curious there are no any babies crying, the baby looks like knowing nothing,
but just showing them harmonies sense and feeling, I was trying to follow the
teacher sing the song with the body language to talk with my baby. It was
really great time there, and I have known how to talk with baby nicely in the future.
