It’s
cooler and cooler with each rain, the saying goes.  This autumn sees little rain, yet it’s still
cooler and cooler with each passing day.Leaves are falling. Master Yang is
nowhere to be seen “sweeping yellow” day and night in my surroundings. Instead，“expatriate” Master Yu is back to take over his broom. Before returning home, Lao
Yang has kept watching and been watched over this lane for almost everyday in years since I moved here and he is always the first man I greet in the first
day of the year, the past new years. Now it’s "returnee" Xiao Yu to greet me at sight. Will he stay cool and hot with my neighborhood and its people for the coming two years left in the rest of his career as well?
