A fine night with a bright moon shining in the clear blackish blue sky. As the Mid-autumn Festival draws near, the moon gets brighter day by day. It is true that the brighter the moon becomes, the fewer the stars can be seen. On such a lovely night, who can look up at the moon with enthusiasm and miss his relatives and old acquaintances who are far away？Friendship and affection among family members have been weakening. When our material life gets rich, our spiritual and emotional world  has been ignored and deserted. That’s why we often feel boredom in lieu of happiness.
