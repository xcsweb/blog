The second day of the fourÔºçday New Year's Day holiday
The cold weather continues and the daily temperature was forecast to go up gradually from the day after tomorrow. 
To have the door-opening cards renewed and buy mother plasters
To enjoy the best time of the day after completing the job to block the gap above the backdoor as mother had assigned. It was about from 2 to 3 pm when the bright and warm slanting sunlight was shining through the window on my back. I sat silently practicing calligraphy with mother lying on the kang thinking aloud unhappily.
