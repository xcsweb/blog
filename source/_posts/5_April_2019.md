Since the establishment of People's Republic of China and the adoption of
reform and opening up policy especially, the nutritional status of our schoolchildren
has improved greatly. 

新中国成立特别是改革开放以来，我国中小学生营养状况得到巨大改善。

With the living standard getting better, they have gained in
height and weight but their physical constitutions have been deteriorating
