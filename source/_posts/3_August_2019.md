A long time has passed since the last time I
went to the market buying vegetables because our garden can supply more than
what we need. 

園圃菜蔬足，市肆久不顧。The leaves of some radish seedlings have almost
been gnawed away by the insects. Then I diluted some insecticide with water and
sprinkled it on the greatly damaged young plants. 

苗葉囓將盡，稀劑以扶傷。It's really hard to be kind to the willful and
arrogant youngsters.行善難，



偏遇恁任性刁頑。A warm-hearted person can move a cold-blooded one after
making unremitting efforts. 一片痴心終不改，



三尺堅冰亦釋然！
