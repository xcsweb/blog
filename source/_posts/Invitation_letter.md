Dear Li Juan

My whole family is excited about your visit. We
are eager to know how long you will be staying with us. As you know, you are
welcome to stay as long as you wish. We have a spare room for you and would
love your company. Don’t worry about finding my house, because I will pick you
up at the airport.

As you plan to come this summer, you should
bring a bathing suit. The weather is usually very hot here in summer, but you
can enjoy yourself in the Water Recreation Center near my home. I’m also going
to take you to other tourist attraction in Beijing, such as Summer Palace,
Great Wall and Forbidden City. If you are interested in the old city of
Beijing, you will definitely be fascinated by the small stores in Nan Luo Gu
Xiang, you can see two wheels vehicle by man, many of traditional Chinese foods.
Beijing Hu Tong as well, where you can taste typical Beijing snack and buy some
special local products, I’m sure you will have a lot of fun here.

I just cannot wait to see you 

                                                                                    Yours
forever
