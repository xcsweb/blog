Anita everybody knows who she is if you are around me,
She is very important person in my life, She has been working in Cambodia more
than four years, every time she came back from there no matter the business or
the holiday for her, the meeting in between must be has.

Why she is important in my life, because we have known
each other since teenage school time, we were in the same training school and
working in the same department for ten years, we can share any secrets each
other, I remembered we were lying one bed in her grandma’s home to see adult
magazines under the dark room, we were so afraid to find by others, We are
jealous each other dating with boy friend before marriage, I was so proud to
have my boyfriend early than her, I was the one to company with her to say bye with
her first love. I can say I know more her than her husband.

The people said both of us were very similar from appearance,
Both have big eyes, the almost same height, that’s why we were confused in the
public, calling me Anita, and she was called Rosanna, only the personality is
different, she is more soft than me, and I am a little bit tough and direct, That’s
making us match together. I have a daughter is one year old than his son, my daughter
went to boarding school was only I was following her action, to educate the
children were more independent instead of spoiled at home. Only because of Chinese
traditional thinking that the wife cannot be old than husband, otherwise we might
be the relative by marriage.

I left the first company and encourage her follow my
action, after 10 years later, She made the big decision to follow my footprint
to join the same group. I can say she was working hard and only one or two years
later, she was accepted by her boss and promoted promptly. By the chance she
left the group and she became the big person and very important position in
this current company. I believe she will have the great future, no matter how
big potato she is, she is mine, right?
