Lu Yonggen has not left his property to his
only daughter. He said, “The party has trained me up, and now it's time to make
my final contribution by returning my personal property to the state.”Secretary
to Lu Yonggen, Zhao Xingjuan said, “The money had been saved little by little
by the old couple. However, both husband and wife were extremely generous when
donating to education and helping the poor every year.”

卢永根没有将财产留给唯一的女儿，他说：“党培养了我，将个人财产还给国家，是作最后的贡献。”卢永根的秘书赵杏娟说：“钱都是老两口一点一点省下来的，对扶贫和教育，两位老人却格外慷慨，每年都要捐钱。”
