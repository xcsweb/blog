Son has returned to his school after passing three nights at home. Yesterday evening he instructed me how to use the panel computer he gave me. He has been tired of using it. I can watch English plays and read British literary works in the original on it.  
A notice about water filling in the heating pipes has been put on at the entrance of the corridor opening into my apartment. It demands each household should leave at least a person at home in case a leakage may happen. Otherwise the heating company wouldn’t be responsible for any damage caused by possible leaking indoors.
