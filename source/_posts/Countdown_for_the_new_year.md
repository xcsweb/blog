Again Christmas is here. And few days later, it will come the new year. On the way home after work, it rained a little bit. Till now it is not that cold, while it is reported it would be really cold few days later. All of a sudden, it comes to the end of this year. When we stay busy in everything, we also face the reality of how time flies. Believe it or not, we are aging. We grow in both mind and body. We become mature and reasonable. We realise what we should do and what else are those things that we are not supposed to be involved in. The cost of life is we sacrifice some time for what we pursue. When we get close to the deadline of 2018, we may exclaim what a year we have gone through.Big promotion can be found among shops and decorations of christmas trees make the atmosphere of Christmas much stronger. The moment I passed by a shoe shop, 
it had already been shut down. Another fruit shop which started business
 few months ago seems selling well. I heard of news some foreign festivals are banned by the local authorities. It does surprise me a lot. It is not bad when it comes to the supportive of advocation of traditional festivals, while the open circumstances allow us to come across the boundary and break through the obstacles.
