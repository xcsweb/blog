I can still remember my former searches for
sweet potatoes left out in the native harvested fields which were empty and
spacious in late autumn. 

憶昔故園拾紅薯，秋野空闊無所覩。I enthusiastically insisted on digging in
the expansive soil for the food in spite of the repeated scouring by others
before. 

任由他人翻百遍，尋興滿懷猶掘土。
