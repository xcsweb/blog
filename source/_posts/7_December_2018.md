On August 20, No. 18 typhoon W this year passed through Dalian City, Liaoning Province. Under its influence, just moored beside the 760th Research Institute of China Shipbuilding Industry, one of State Key Experimental Platforms was in great danger. At the critical moment, Huang, a member of the Party Committee and deputy director of the institute, and other 16 of his colleagues fearlessly rushed out to reinforce the platform in spite of the typhoon and huge waves. In the operation, H, S and J were drawn into the sea by the mighty waves and laid down their lives heroically.
