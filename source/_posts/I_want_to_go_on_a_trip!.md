Since half of the summer holiday has passed by, my husband and I are talking about what to do in August these days. We have two choices ,continuing to stay at home and taking a trip. If we stay at home, it is comfortable and there is no need to spend money. But in that case, we will learn little about the world.If we go on a trip, we can broaden our view and gain knowledge we cannot get from books. Some of our friends suggest that we should go to places of interest nearby. I think that it is a good idea. It does not cost much, yet we can still learn a lot. Moreover, my babies are too young to take a long journey. So I want to go to the beach with my family. I think in the next few days I should make a plan for our trip and prepare some necessaryÂ  things. At the present time, I am expect to enjoy the upcoming trip with my family. So much for today!
