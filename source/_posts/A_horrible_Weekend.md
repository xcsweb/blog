“Weekend”is a
word that usually makes me happy. The word brings back memories of Weekend
morning get up late and spent watching films on television. Last weekend,
unfortunately, almost changed the meaning of the word; it was a terrible day.

Every
weekend we go to Pan Shan house to take care my plants, trees and my lovely
flowers. At the spring of this year we bought a lot fresh flowers to decorate my
courtyard. But Tiger gave me a big surprise that he wanted to install a lift in
the room at this golden period of the year. Due to this year his waist was not
good, he was a little worry he cannot be up to the floor in some day later. And
his friend’s home has been done it at their third floor villa, that’s why Tiger
has planned to follow him to install an elevator at our home. Even I did not
agree he still insist to do so.

Anyway
I was hardly to change his mind, just leave it like it I thought. As we
expected the term of renovation will be last about one month. I have locked
some rooms, and let living room and bed room was opened. After two weeks past,
there was only digging a big hole at outside, the inside of the room was
nothing happened, we was told that this was for waterproof, it must be waiting
till it was dry, ok anyway I agree. And before starting renovation, the leader
of worker promised me everything in the room should be covered, but the last
weekend when we came to see it, there were many garbage and muck at the entrance
of door, in the room some of furniture, curtains and printings on the wall were
not covered, everywhere was dusty at the all. 

At
first I was so angry with Tiger to blame how come like it, let him to talk with
the supplier to change the situation as soon as possible, otherwise my beautiful
rooms will be destroy, Tiger was a kind man to talk with the organizer nicely, and
He was only worry about the time limit of the project, I have to talk with
supplier directly and strongly, let them to cover everything they can including
carpet before starting it.

We
were told that the time of project will have to wait other two weeks, these
days I have seen some photos of the lift it looks not bad actually, I was a little
at easy. Now I am really hope it will be a big surprise to show us.
