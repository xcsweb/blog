We selected the seats of the plane was in front
which can stench the legs for long trip, even it might pay 500rmb extra, you
know Daniel he know how and where to buy the ticket with big discount, it was unbelievable
the price of the round trip ticket is only xxxx.

Anita always persuades me we’d better take the business
class if it is over 5 or 6 hours on the plane. I agree totally, but when I compare
the price with economic class, you know it is cost a lot. I am a little bit
talking myself, maybe next time. And this trip everything was following them. As
our ages for long trip I have to prepare more stuff on the plane just in case,
I bought the pillows for legs and neck, the small blanket which might lie on
the ground if possible. Unfortunately the space of the first line should be
keep empty, so everything is useless for my stuff, anyway all well Tiger and I
was smoothly on the plane for 11 hours, maybe it was the day time flight.

Los Angeles was our first stop, everybody
looked so pale and tired after took off the plane, and for sure sleeping was
the first important thing, and release jet lag as early as we can.

Renting the car in Salt Lake city, which is a
small city, the service on the counter was so slow and no any efficient at all,
and no more car to select except only one grey car parking there. In my imagination,
we might rent a red roadster, how cool it is on the west of US! You know we
have four people and three big suit cases, this time just forget it.

Xiang Hui he is the youngest one in our team,
he and Daniel is the second time self driving travel in US, that’s why they
know how to rent the car, what’s the rule in America of traffic, GPS which has
to buy in local to set up and down load the map in advance. You know Yellow Park
there is no signal for cell phone, that’s why it cannot be guide system. The
driving license must be with a translation attached and one car at least two
licenses available.
