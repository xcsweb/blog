The ideas on which is the best way of learning
about life vary from person to person. Some people hold that the best way of
learning about life is by listening to the advice from family and friends.
However, other people hold that it could be achieved through personal
experience. As to me, I agree with the second opinion.

For one thing, it seems to be true that from
other people you can get some suggestions about life, but it doesn’t mean that
others ideas could be applied to your life situations, for each person is
different from others in his background and life style. For another, it could
also be argued that family and friends’ ideas could be helpful, but your
personal experience teachers you more about how to achieve success, how to deal
with different people. It is often said that we learn something by doing it in
person.

Therefore, the first idea cannot stand up to
our real life. We should learn about life in practice.
