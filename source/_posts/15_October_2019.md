As an incapable person, with whom can I compete？

平庸無能，與誰爭鋒？

Having enough to eat and wear, what can I complain
about? 

旣得温飽，云胡不平？

Now that we have been predestined, it is best
to be satisfied with our current state and keep a peaceful mind.

造化之道，守拙是寜。

How can we ignore our physical and mental health
when absorbed in seeking external wealth? 

身之與物，孰重孰輕？
