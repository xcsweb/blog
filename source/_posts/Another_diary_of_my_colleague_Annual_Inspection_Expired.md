The Djiboutians are generally
amicable to our Chinese living in Djibouti.

They often greet us
warmly “Ni Hao”, when we were walking in street or shopping mall.

However, this is not
always the case.

One day, policemen
stopped our car while we were passing a crossroad. Our car was driving by our
local driver, and I was sure that the driver did not run through the red light,
so I thought we would be released rapidly.

After checking the vehicle
documents, a policeman told us seriously that the annual inspection of our car
was expired. 

Through a simple negotiation,
we gave him 5000 Djibouti Franc cash and we were released soon with no receipt at
all.

Once returning, we
planned to proceed immediately to the vehicle’s annual inspection. Finally our
vehicle was not inspected either, because the vehicle inspection office found
that the annual inspection would be expired in August 2019. No vehicle could be
inspected before its expiry date.
