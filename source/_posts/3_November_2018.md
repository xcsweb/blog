Today is sunday, I had a lie-in. I woke up on 7 o'clock while got up on 8 o'clock. I'm so lazy!!! Deng sent a qq measage to me after I slept, I reply to her. I went toÂ dining room to ate baozi after I brushing my tooth and washing my face. My book Machine Learing is on the way. So sad !!! Though my python is not good, but I still want to study Machine Learning. trike load of the recyclable. I decided to make up for it tomorrow. But unluckily, there will be sleet tomorrow according to the weather forecast. 
*It's so hot in the flat that I have to be stripped to the waist. I tend to be dazed and sleepy at such a high temperature. Then I rubbed myself down with a wet towel both for cleaning and cooling.
