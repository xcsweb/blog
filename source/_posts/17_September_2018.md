Recent good weather makes it possible for me to take the short dirt path with little traffic. The road surface can be said smoother. Both the bike and the trike can pass the quiet route. Most of the path is just like a lane flanked by standing corn stems. Now that the rainy season has almost come to a close, I can enjoy the journey through it for the coming days. The road condition will be at its best in the harvest season for the transporting vehicles come back and forth all day long on it. This year the road seems not to be busy as before because some fields are either deserted or planted with trees or vegetables. Â
