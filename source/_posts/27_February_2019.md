Bai Fangli came from Baijia village, Cangxian county, Hebei Province.


白方礼，河北省沧县白贾村人。

He moved countless Chinese for subsidizing nearly 300 poverty‐stricken
students with the ￥ 350,000 earned
by pedaling his tricycle transporting passengers from 74 covering a distance
equaling circling the equator 18 times.

从74岁开始，白方礼用相当于绕赤道18周的奔波，将蹬三轮车挣得的35万元用于支教，资助了近300名贫困学生，感动了无数国人。
