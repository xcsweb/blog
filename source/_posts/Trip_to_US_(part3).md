Grand Teton is national park and one of our
destinations as well, it has beautiful snow mountains with 4198 meters height,
there are about 20 more snow mountains and Green Lake. There are many kind of
animals we are hard to call the name, but we had to know enjoy a safe visit and
be bear aware, quietly from a safe distance 100 yards from bears and wolves, 25
yards from all other animals, the park newspaper lists schedules of ranger-led
activities like talks, walks, hikes, demonstrations. 

Using geology and vegetation as clues, you can
determine key wildlife habitat. Geology, plants and animals interact dynamically
over a large region; the mission of the National Park Service is to safeguard
national and cultural resources for enjoyment of this and future generations.
Please help care for this beautiful place. This youthful landscape gave me so
impressive.

The park ‘s clean air, water and natural sounds
enhance our visit and quality of habitat for native species, the parkway let
you enjoy nature’s sights and sound safely. Stay on trails to protect native
vegetation.
