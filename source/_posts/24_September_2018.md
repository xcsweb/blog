Every day of the three-day holiday was rainy and the rain was just slight and short. But every night the moon still made its appearance.
Sister and brother came over seeing mother with moon cakes in turn. Because son has phoned to say that he is to come back at the National Day holiday making a new video of mother on her birthday and sending it to the special website as demanded, we decided to keep the cakes for him. 
Yesterday evening I picked some edible green beans, flour and rice deserted at the rubbish carts in our housing estate.
