    Over past six months, I was reminded again
and again that result should be attached more attention than process. In other
words, you only need to care what you get rather than how you go through. Maybe
it is a cost-effective way in the management, with an overwhelming and
domineering style of simplicity and brutality. However, as we ponder the
viewpoint carefully, we will find it is paradoxical in the cause and effect
relationship. As the old saying goes:” Every effect has its cause”. The ignoring
of process is equal to turn a blind eye on the cause, and resulted in an
underestimation of difficulty or even bias on the target-making or decision-making.
Just like we have never talked about a translation without the context, so is
the implementation of corporate policy and marketing strategy. 

    To a great extent, the management level
just intends to intensify the effort in the implementation of policy, fend off
the objection, noise or doubts towards the managing policy and finally eliminate
all excuses to fail to realize the target. Under the circumstance, we have to
follow the principle of “Your duty is to do and die, not to reason and why”. Imagine
you are a boss or an employee, how to make a balance in the dilemma? Welcome
