I am newcomer in DioEnglish. I want to writing English blogs to keep the feeling of English writing as well as improve my poor spelling caused by replying too much on the function of computer auto correction.I am very busy at my work, so my blogs will be short at most of the time. My purpose is to make writing a habit rather than a pure sharing of my happiness、sadness  or something odd and special. Hope to make progress together with all the friends who love English writing.If you think that there are any mistakes, either in grammar or  the way of  expression, please kindly point them out. I'd also like to exchange ideas about how to improve English with you.  Of course, anything related  with the content of my blog is welcome to comment. Anyway, it is basic for blogs sharing, no matter what language used to write.
