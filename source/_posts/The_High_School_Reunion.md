For most people, attending high school reunions is a problem because they become unfamiliar with each other after many years had past. As time goes by, memories of good old days seem to vanish away. There is no more common ground for the rich and the poor. Different people have different focuses so there is no common topic worth discussing.But if we keep a normal and calm mentality to view this matter, we’ll find high school reunions are interesting things and have their meanings. We can find those common students have become excellent people and contrary to the good students who turned to ordinary ones. Actually, those phenomenon are not important to me. I will gladly attend high school reunions and see my friends spending happy lives and those lovely girls from the past remained beautiful. We might recall all kinds interesting things while we attending the reunions.
