The story of the old frontiersman losing
his horse means that everything may transform into the opposite. It's universally true
that good fortune lies within bad and bad fortune lurks within good. 

塞翁失馬寓轉化，福禍伏倚無際涯。Who knows but that one's gloomy mood yesterday
will be replaced by an ecstatic mood today？

焉知昨日哭喪臉，今朝心中花不現？
