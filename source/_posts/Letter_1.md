December 17, 2018Dear Dean,    I am terribly sorry to tell you that I'm not able to give the lecture on Chinese Culture next Monday afternoon as we have planned. I was informed this morning that my tutor will meet me that day to talk about a very urgent problem in my research project.    I feel honored to be invited to give such a lecture talk, and I think it is a good opportunity for me to exchange with my colleagues to help them know more about Chinese Culture. Can we decide on another date for it, say, next Friday afternoon?    I hope that I will not bring too much trouble to you, and I apologize for that again.    With best wishes.                                                                                                                               Yours sincerely,Jack Peng
