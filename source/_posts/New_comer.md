    Today, the new quality engineer is on board. He is from another city that means he will take shuttle-bus for commuting, as a new comer he will spend period of time to learn something new that is different from his previous working style. As he said, the previous company he worked for is a big company than that of now, I guess he will suffer a difficult time, because our company is pretty small than most of others, not only the size of the company, but the headcount of employee. The advantage of small company has a relative good welfare and has a more flexible working style, the disadvantage is that we will take some multi-function tasks because of short-hand and it is becoming common to amortize some tasks to share work loading from trans department that means we have to afford more to keep balance even we need frequently work overtime. I am not sure whether the new comer can adapt new working environment, but, I hope he can do it well.    Anyway, everything has two side, all depend on how decision you make, I hope the new quality engineer can endure the transitional period and do a good job in his position.
