After plastering the cleared kang this morning, on my way to our flat I went to the place where I used to pay for heating supply, which is near the boiler room behind the central school. Unluckily a man there told me the fee collecting has been suspended at the spot and I have to go to the newly-built housing estate a few miles away west of our town paying the fee. After lunch I headed for the charging office by bike. Because I didn’t know exactly where it was, I asked the way several times before reaching the building. But it was closed to my disappointment.
