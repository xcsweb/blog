It's pleasant that the day has brightened up. The rain
is suspended and the sun appears with a soft wind. 

可喜今日天色開，雨住日出徐風來。I've ever known the novel Les Miserables long before. I've been
absorbed in it recently at night. 

悲慘世界早聞説，近夕捧讀愛不舍。Victor Hugo is really adorable for his
talent and learning. Most films adapted from the masterpieces have blasphemed
against the originals. 

雨果才學令人折，影視什九褻名作。
