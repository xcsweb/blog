Arrived at school just before the starting time of our work. First saw Ms F sweeping with some of her students at the shrubbery in front of the classrooms. Then noticed our principal coming over and asking about me reproachfully. I went to meet him bravely after parking my trike under the willows. Because I had known why he was in a rage with me, I explained to him why I hadn’t done cleaning as demanded. I told him I could remove the rubbish instead of preparing the writing materials if necessary. He wondered if another one could replace me for the writing. My answer was negative.
