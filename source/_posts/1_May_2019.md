Life is the best teacher. No one ever told
me to be thrifty, but I accomplish the virtue of frugality for the hardship in
my early years. It's a pity to see so many foods and daily essentials going to waste. Then
I couldn’t help becoming a scavenger. Without experiencing the shortage of
money, the children and juveniles have no idea of thrift. They never treasure
the welfare they enjoy unless something happens to them. It's almost futile to
remonstrate with them to avoid extravagance. One's life is incomplete if he's ignorant about its
bitter taste. The parents might as well leave their children alone up to a
certain time as the panther departs from its young.
