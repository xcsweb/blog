A well disciplined class can keep good order even in the absence of its adviser or any other teacher. The monitor and head of each group will take charge of the class for its adviser. No student dare challenge the authority of these classmates of his because they are the academic elite. Sometimes they share the teaching task and allot study assignments to the students and correct the papers later. Grade Three is such a class in our school, which gives all us teachers a good impression. We should owe this achievement to Ms B, a capable class adviser. It is her who has successfully trained these helpful assistants in work and study. Â
