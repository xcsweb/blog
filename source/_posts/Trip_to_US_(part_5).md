This was the fourth day In Yellow park from the
east to the west and following number 8 line we went to every corners, but we
have not given full expression to the view, we still wanted to stay longer and
more. This trip for living we were almost one night only and then move to next
stop, we have to follow our schedule.

After whole day visiting the west of Yellow Stone
Park, it was dark outside and late, everybody was tied especially our dear
Xiang Hui he drove all day long without close his eyes for the seconds, As our
plan tonight we will stay the last night there, when we checked in the hotel, a
girl she was the receptionist told us the forecast tomorrow will have a heavy
snow, she suggested we’d better get out of here tonight, otherwise the road
will be closed, maybe one day or more. That mean we had to drive other 100 km
away to get out of the park, we checked the internet to confirm the weather it
was again, no doubt, and finally we decided we go immediately.

I should thank the girl to tell us the information
of the weather; unfortunately I did not take the photo for her, but still
remember her kindly smiling face. It was true the next early morning outside, the
large snowflakes were falling to cover every corner, to be the silver world and
like a fairy tale world. I forgot where I was, just enjoy the beautiful view, taking
the photos in different poses, the boys were busy with snow removing from the
car to make sure safe for driving, that’s different for girl and boy.

The hotel breakfast was not bad, the cold milk,
juices, fruits, I like waffle very much, which was making by yourself, only it
was warm and not too sweet at all, everything we were used to have it, before
we left there we took the bottle coffee away for each of us on the car as
native people.

Enjoying the view from the window is wonderful,
after seeing heavy snow for the small town and following there were many big
white clouds hanging on the blue sky, unbelievable pictures we had, I was totally
moved again.
