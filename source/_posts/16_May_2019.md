Luke marries Meggie just for obtaining the large sum of her yearly income. Once he reaches his aim, he takes her to Himmelhoch, leaving her
penniless long behind as a servant in Anne’s household. After depositing all her money, he goes to different
places cutting sugar canes. He works very hard and grudges spending money even
for himself. He plans to buy themselves a house when enough money is saved. He fails
to return to her when she gives birth to their daughter. But at the moment, much
to her relief, Archbishop Ralph comes and leaves her a check for her daily
expenses. Soon he makes another visit to her before departing for Europe. It is on this trip that Anne offers him a chance
to commit adultery with Meggie on the secluded Matlock Island.
