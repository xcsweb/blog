Since that day I happily found that an English
film is shown on the Channel of English Tutoring at 10 pm daily, I have been
keeping seeing the original films by the playing time every night. Two nights
ago, I appreciated the horrible film The Fall of the House of Usher adapted
from a story written by Edgar Allen Poe with the same name. The dilapidated old
mansion with numberless dim labyrinthine rooms and its eccentric dwellers create
an atmosphere of fear. In the two days that followed, I searched for the
fiction on the net and read it through. In the meantime, I made a humiliating
discovery that most of the spoken English I heard is beyond my comprehension.
