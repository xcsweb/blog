Can you accept the first meeting is late a half hour
by your partner, no matter who they are, maybe is your friend, your teacher or
colleague, ect, I hardly accept it I am sorry to say. I am the one very self-discipline,
especially for the time I so care about the time, the time is money, for any
appointments if some unavoidable cases happened, you might be late 10
minutes, and then you can give me a call in advance to tell the reason. May be
the traffic, everybody knows that the capital of Beijing’s traffic just likes
baby cry, very normal, but if I go for a meeting to somewhere, I prefer taking
the subway to avoid it. If I have some urgent things around me by the last
minute, I have to tell my partner in any ways as I can, text of wechat, voice
message or a call directly. It will be never happened to me there is no any
reasons for the late.

Hopefully everybody here learns from me at this point.
Thanks!
