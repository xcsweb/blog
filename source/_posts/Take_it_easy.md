Never take something for granted, because it is awful. In life, we are easy to be into that condition of feeling something good by no judgement. Out of mind, we do not even understand what is going on. Instead, we just make a decision by on means of practice. The impulse buy is such a thing to happen once we are in the mall, especially at the time for sale. Many items we hardly use as of we paid the bill many months ago. Meanwhile, it is a waste of money.To avoid that kind of problem, we are supposed to make a list before shopping. By writing down what kind of things we are surely to buy can save us time and avoid being in the mass of buying many things are not related to daily life. The best way to test if a thing is 
good or not is to put it into practice. A programme, a book, a song and 
so forth, if you want to see if it is just that good, you have to use 
it. After that, the feedback is to give you back the information.
