On my travel to school this morning I began wearing my gloves to resist the cold. I left the shaded chilly printing room where I usually stay alone and moved to the sunny warm office where a seat is reserved for me. Suddenly an idea occurred to me on how to wisely use the deserted hardened flour I picked the other day. The flour has deteriorated obviously and somewhat discolored. Although it has become inedible, it can be made paste we needn't grudge. Then I can use the paste sticking paper slips onto the crevices of the draughty windows facing north before sealing them with plastics.
