Everywhere is filled up with mosquitoes involving dormetory's room,class room and selfstudy room, despite time has already past the mid-autumn festival. i got 7bites on my left ankle yesterday evening in the selfstudy room and i was in long trousers! That's iching untill now. What's more, i am listening to annoying slight noise inside the mosquito bed net made by wings at the very present time.Oh my dear god, who can solve this problem?    This summer when I was in London, there is no such insect anywhere. I don't want to be crude but why can't we kill this species of pests and watch it die out with cheers!!!
