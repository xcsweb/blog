Lushan Mountain is located in the northern part of Jiangxi
Province, to the south of the Yangtze River and northwest of the Poyang Lake.
According to records, it has a history of more than 2,000 years.  I have been there at 20 years ago of red
tour with the company, the impression was the mountain as landscape picture with
misty rain and cloud.

I was invited
by one of my friends to Lushan Mountain at the last week; surely I was so glad
that one of my places to visit again after confirmed the time with three couple’s
trip. We were so luck that one of friend was the key person in the railway
station, that’s why we took there by train with soft sleeper, which was much
comfortable than airplane, due to it was good for smokers and more space than
by air. 

In my imagination
before it was taken at least one hour by car from the foot to the top with
mountain plate, you had to suffer car sickness. But this time surprise me that
it was only taken 10 minutes by cableway, we have to say it is really great of
our china with so fast developing at the everywhere. 

We were
exciting that our hotel was located just at the side of lake named Ru Qin Lake,
which is like a instrument, every morning or after dinner we walked around the
lake for a while, the scenery in
Lushan Mountain scenic area is breathtaking. It is full of sheer peaks and
precipices, changeable clouds and fogs, silver springs and flying waterfalls. Three
of our ladies would like taking the photos or videos in different poses under
the beautiful nature view, we forgot the time totally enjoy the moment. Meilu
Villa, the modern villas are quite a sight on Lushan Mountain. Each villa is an
individual building complex with unique style and structure; we would like take the walk around there with
heavy plants and trees, of course we cannot miss the chance to take the
pictures with sense of time.

Lushan
Mountain was elected to the "World Heritage List" in 1996. Owing to
its congenial climate, it is also a popular summer resort in China. 

It was
the really great trip this time, for my friends they came here at the last
year, and this year still wanted to come again, you can say how good place for
summer visit, please share my photos with you all.
