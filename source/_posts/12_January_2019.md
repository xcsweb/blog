Thanks to My FamilyMr Zhong Nanshan's message



Father, you had ever said if a man couldn’t leave
something worthy behind he would be said to have lived in vain. Now over
eighty, I gradually get to see the meaning of your words. I have preliminarily
realized your wishes by now but I'm not satisfied yet.  I have two more tasks to accomplish according
to schedule. I daren’t say I have reached the goal you set for me before completing
them. My grandchildren, you must well remember our
fine family traditions. First, devote all efforts to an honorable pursuit;
second, be meticulous and precise in your work.
