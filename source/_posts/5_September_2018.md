Mother strongly opposes me to lend the large sum asked by late wife's sister the other day. I agreed to her request on the phone without any hesitation. I just told her I need some time to prepare for it. My current deposit is short of the requirement. To satisfy her demand I must withdraw some of my fixed deposit. She has ever been one of our benefactors for helping us with the construction of our bungalow. But when I think of her spending money lavishly and inability to pay back, I have to take back my promise. I can't lend the money accumulated by stinting ourselves.
