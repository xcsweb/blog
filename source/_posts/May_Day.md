Today is the 100th anniverary of May Fourth Movement. A century ago, that movement started a new chapter of Chinese history. Because of the special day, this May Day has a four-day leave that I could have fun. It has no rain. The sunny day really has brought its peace that I just do nothing but enjoy the tranquility.Â Half of the time was spent on books which now becomes the routine I do not feel well if I do not read something. When I watched news from TV that many tourists were stuck on their trip, I think I was wise again by choosing to go nowhere.
