The three-day-long rainy weather has come
to an end. Yesterday evening the weather forecast said it would turn cloudy
after showering. It  has really happened as predicted. Last night a heavy shower
came down with claps of thunder. After daybreak it did not rain any more. But the
sky was still overcast and menacing until noon. The dirt path west of our
bungalow was muddy and dotted with puddles. My old bike continued to carry me
to school. At present, it is sunny and windy outside. Large white clouds are
moving west in the bluish sky. It is forecast that tomorrow will be fine. Then my
old bike can be off duty and the new should take its turn.
