	Computer hardware is the equipment involved in the function of a computer and consissts of the components that can be phusically handled,the function of these components is tupiocally divided into three main categories impit output and storage components in these  categories connect to microprocessprs, specificallu,the computers central processing unit the electronic circuiryu that provides the computational abilityu and control of the computer via wires or circuitryu called a bus	Software on the other hand is the set of instructions a computer uses to mainipulate data,such as a word processing program or a videdo game these programs are usually stored and transferred via the computers hardware to and from the cpu software also governs ow the hardware is utilized how imfomation os retrieved from a storage device the interaction between the imput and output hardware is contrlled by the software called the basic io system although microprocessprs are stilll technically considered to be hardware portions of their function are also associated with computer software since mio have both hardwawre and software aspects are  referred  as for,ware	I hardware	I condists of external devices that is components outside of the cp cou that provide information and instuctions to the compiter,a logjt pen is a stulus with a light sensitive tip that is used to draw directlu on a cp video screen or to select information on the screen bu pressing a clip in the light pen or by pressing the light pen against the surface of the screen the pen contains light sensors that identify which portion of the screen it is passed over a mouse is a pointing device desinged to be gripped by one hand it has a detection device on the boottom that enables the user to control the motion of an on screen ponter or cursor by moving the mouse on a flat surface as the device moves across the surface, the cursor moves acrosss the screen to select items or choose commands on the screen the user presses a buttin on the mouse a joystick is a pointing device composed of a lever that moves in multiple directions  to navigate a cursor or other graphical object on a computer screen a keyboard is a tyoewriter like device that allows the user to tyoe in textr and comands to the computer some keyboards have special function keys or intergtrrated pointing devices such as a rackball or touch sensitive regions that let the users finger motions move an on screen cursor an optical scanner uses light sensing equpment to convert images such as a picture or text into electronic signals that can be manipulated by a computer a photograph can be scanned into a compiter and then included in a text document created on that computer,the 2 most common scaner types are the flatbed scanner  which is similar to an office pcopier and the hand held scanner which is passed manually across the image to be processed a microphione is device for converting sound into signals that can then be stored manipulated and played back by the computer a voice recognition module is a device that converts soken words into information that the compter can recognize and precess amodem which stands for modulator demodulator is adevice that connects a computer to a telephine line and allows information to be transmitted to or received from another co,each computer that sends or receives information must be connected to a modem the info sent from one computer is converted by the modem into an audio signal which is then transmitted b telephone lines to the receiving modem,which is then transmiitted by the phone lines to the receiving modem which converts the signal into info that the receiving co can understand	Output Hardware	out consist of external devicess that transfer info from the compiters cpu to the compiter user,a video display,or screen,concerts info generated by the computer into visual info displays comonly take one of two forms a video screen with a cathode ray tube or a video screen with a liquid cystal display a crt based screen or monitor looks similar to a television set info from the cpu is displayed using a beam of electrons that scans a phosphorescent suface that emits light and creates images an lcd0based screen ddisplays visual information on a flatter and smaller screen than a based video mnitor lcds are frequently used in laptop compurers	printers take text and image from a computer and print them on paper dot matrix printers use tiy wires to impact upon an inked ribbon to form characters laser printers employ beams of light to draw images on a drim that then picks up fine black particles called toner , the toner is fused a page tp produce an image inkject printers fire drpplets of ink onto a page to form characters and pictures	Stirage Gardware	provides permanent storage of info and programs for retrieval by the computer the 2 main types of disk frives devices are disk frives and memory, there are several types of disk frives hard floppy magneto potical and compact hard disk drives store info in magnetic particles embedded in a disk usually a permanent part of the computer hard disk drives can store large amounts of info and retrieve that info very quickly floppy disk drives
