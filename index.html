As to<br>where to buy a new house, sometimes it is difficult to make a wise decision.</p>
<p>Some people choose to buy house in downtown, because<br>life is very convenient and comfortable to people living in downtown. For<br>example, it is always easy to do shopping because there are many different<br>stores in downtown. In addition, many educational and cultural facilities such<br>as public libraries, museums are within easy reach.</p>
<p>Although living in downtown has many<br>advantages, I still prefer owning a house in suburbs. I have good reasons to<br>make such decision. First, the price for a house in suburbs is relatively<br>cheaper. That is to say, with the same amount of money you use to buy a small<br>flat in downtown, you can buy an independent house in suburbs. What’s more,<br>living in quiet, peaceful surroundings, you can listen Cicada sing clearly in<br>summer, you can breathe the fresh air every morning, you can plant whatever you<br>like such as flowers and vegetables, you can see the mountain through your<br>winder.</p>
<p>Only one thing I have a little worry about<br>medical facility, which is at least five or ten years later. You know as our<br>ages, I believe everyone is false health, they may have to have something wrong<br>after annual health checking, near the hospital or pick up the medicines is<br>very important for us.</p>
<p>Compare this and that, Buying a house in suburbs<br>is my first choice. </p>

As time passes, the truth will be<br>exposed. However, the public would rather be absorbed in fictions than pursue<br>the facts. Some historic dramas and novels have distorted facts for personal or<br>political reasons. Therefore, lots of historic truth has been concealed for so<br>long. Some figures have been defamed and some deified, which has prevented<br>modern people from forming right opinions about those personages. So historic<br>dramas and novels have deceived audiences and readers while they give people an<br>enjoyable entertainment. Even people of higher education can hardly avoid the<br>deception.   </p>

It’s ridiculous for the parents to<br>lay their high hope in these untamed youngsters. If they could keep away from<br>committing crimes and being fatally ill, their parents should feel lucky<br>enough. How can one expect such children to support and take care in one’s later life?

When I taught biology, I had ever seen one of the illustrations in the textbook, which recorded how a bird fed a fish in a pond regularly. According to the reference book, the bird probably had just lost her baby and then took the fish as a substitute. Another special case similar to this one happened in the documentary played on TV today. A lioness rescued a baby gnu just born from the hunting hyenas. She kept the vulnerable young company for some time and then took her departure. The puzzled mother had to stand far away watching anxiously before reuniting with her baby. </p>
